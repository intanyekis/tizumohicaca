However, there's a stigma in Hollywood that dramatic <strong>actors</strong> can't be funny, and <a href=#>comedians can't be serious</a>. There are a select few, however, that have proven everybody wrong. Here are ten dramatic <strong>actors</strong> who went on to star in <a href=#><strong>sitcoms</strong></a>:</p><h2 id=rob-lowe><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Rob Lowe</span></h2><p>Rob Lowe has been acting since the '80s. A young heartthrob, Lowe had roles in iconic films, including St. Elmo's Fire.&nbsp;The actor later starred in NBC political drama The West Wing, but he&nbsp;switched gears from drama to comedy when he was cast as&nbsp;the perpetually&nbsp;positive fitness freak Chris Traeger in NBC's mockumentary <a href=#>Parks and Recreation</a>.&nbsp;Lowe has had roles on a variety of television shows and movies since his time on Parks and Rec, and can currently be found on the series&nbsp;9-1-1: Lone Star.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=andre-braugher><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Andre Braugher</span></h2><p>Actor Andre Braugher has also been acting for decades.

The show started on Fox and was picked up by NBC after being cancelled by Fox. NBC has announced <a href=#>the show will end</a> after its upcoming eighth season.</p><h2 id=john-goodman><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>John Goodman</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At the start of his career, John Goodman had roles in lots of movies, spanning many genres, including crime, mystery, drama, and romance. In the early '90s, he landed a starring role in hit sitcom Roseanne as the titular character's husband Dan Conner. Goodman has had lots of other roles since, including Sully in Pixar cartoons&nbsp;Monsters, Inc.&nbsp;and prequel&nbsp;Monsters University. Goodman later&nbsp;reprised his role of Dan Conner for the Roseanne reboot, and again for the spin-off&nbsp;The Conners.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Where's Roseanne Ever Since She Got Fired?</a></span></p><h2 id=paul-sun-hyung-lee><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Paul Sun-Hyung Lee</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Korean Canadian actor and television host Paul Sun-Hyung Lee has been in the entertainment industry for decades now.

Hubert had&nbsp;a part in the movie&nbsp;21 Jump Street&nbsp;before being cast as Vivian Banks, wife of Philip and aunt of Will alongside James Avery in The Fresh Prince of Bel Air.&nbsp;Her tenure on the show did not last the entire series, however, reportedly due to an ongoing feud with co-star Will Smith.
