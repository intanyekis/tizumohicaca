Papoose <a href=#>shared</a> why he enjoys going the independent route, and further explained that the <a href=#>Illuminati</a> influences media, while <a href=#>The-Dream and The Weeknd</a> let tempers flare on Twitter, firing shots at one another.</p><h2>Chuck D Says Bill Clinton Ruined Radio, Why You’ll Be Voting For Barack Obama</h2><p>Chuck D continued his <a href=#>in-depth interview with HipHopDX</a> this week, touching on a few injustices in the political arena. The Public Enemy front man touched on Bill Clinton’s Telecommunications Act of 1996, which consolidated radio ownership and may have played a part in limiting message-driven music. “Yeah, [that] was the real nail in the coffin – not so much to message-driven music but to local music being able to have a chance to independently breathe,” he said. Chuck also touched on the importance of reelecting <a href=#>President Barack Obama</a>, stating that letting another political entity in could be dangerous for the United States.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><h2>Kid CuDi Shares Excitement Over WZRD Sales</h2><p>Kid CuDi wasn’t too pleased when <a href=#>WZRD</a>, his project with Dot Da Genius, was released a few weeks ago, claiming that his label Universal Republic <a href=#>undershipped the project </a>to stores. But then the album debuted at No. 3 on the charts with over 70,000 copies sold, making him<a href=#> sing a different tune</a>. “I think it definitely proves a point, that there was a method to my madness, that the kids are out there and they want the music,” he said. “It’s just like a that’s-what-I-fucking thought-type of thing. Not just to the label or whatever – I’m not going to say the label had no faith in the project – just kind of to the naysayers and people that didn’t really believe in it.”</p><h2>Papoose Discusses Nacirema Dream, Illuminati’s Media Influence</h2><p>Papoose <a href=#>spoke with HipHopDX</a> this week about his independent hustle and finally releasing debut <a href=#>Nacirema Dream</a>. During the chat, the New York City, New York rapper explained that his hometown’s reputation is still strong, even with Southern Hip Hop taking the reins over the past few years. He also touched on his upcoming debut, how he wouldn’t change its title and why there are most likely<a href=#> Illuminati forces</a> orchestrating media.<a href=#> Read the full interview here</a>.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><h2>The-Dream & The Weeknd Fire Shots On Twitter</h2><p>The-Dream and The Weeknd took their R&Beef to new heights this past week, using their Twitter accounts to<a href=#> take digs at one another</a>. After Terius Nash performed in New York City, New York and subliminally slandered the Canadian crooner, The Weeknd took to the social networking site and called him a “ham burglar lookin’ ass nigga,” among other things. The-Dream responded with a long Twitter rant, stating that “Beef wld have to mean insecurity” but that “I think the world of the boy.”</p><p>Other items of note:</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p><a href=#>– A$AP Rocky Calls Some XXL Freshmen “Corny As Fuck”</a></p><p><a href=#>– Mystikal Says Lil Wayne & Baby Saved His Life, Talks Prison Experience</a></p><p><a href=#>– Young Guru Says That L.A.
