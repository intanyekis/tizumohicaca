Yet behind bars, Josh has apparently not been following the rules and may have consequences to face for it.</p><h2 id=where-is-josh-duggar-in-prison>Where Is Josh Duggar In Prison?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/josh-anna-duggar-tlc.jpg><p>While the Duggar family is originally from Arkansas, Josh Duggar is currently behind bars in Seagoville, Texas, at <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">FCI Seagoville</a> (the FCI stands for Federal Correctional Institution).</p><p>The facility is a low-security one, and its website notes that there is "an adjacent minimum security satellite camp and a detention center." It's said that <a href=#>some of Josh's family visits him, specifically his wife Anna and their seven kids</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Given the prison's visitation rules, it's unclear whether the whole family is able to visit at once; guidelines as of 2023 stipulate that inmates are permitted five visitors in an up-to-two-hour period. Visits can be terminated for a variety of reasons, one being "improper conduct."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>This Is What Locals In Tontitown Arkansas Really Think Of The Duggar Family</a></span></p><p>Further, visitation is only permitted on the weekends, and immediate family members are the only ones allowed to visit without additional authorization. That means Josh's cousins, grandparents, aunts and uncles, or nieces and nephews cannot visit him.</p><p>Duggar's attorney can visit him more frequently with advance written notice, including on non-visitation days. It seems that visitation is only permitted from Friday through Monday and on federal holidays.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's unclear whether Josh has ever been housed there, but FCI Seagoville says that inmates housed in "Administrative Detention and Disciplinary Segregation" cannot receive visitors; they're only permitted video visits.</p><h2 id=josh-duggar-already-got-in-trouble-for-breaking-prison-rules>Josh Duggar Already Got In Trouble For Breaking Prison Rules</h2><p>What happens when prisoners break the rules? It depends on the facility (and the state), but in many cases, inmates wind up with a 'writeup' of sorts. Depending on the severity of the offense, inmates can get extra time tacked onto their sentence for rule-breaking.</p><p>Something as minor as possessing cash in jail can result in additional charges for possessing contraband and offenses like smuggling in cell phones or illicit substances are equally serious. It turns out, however, that the correctional institutions in Texas take their rules seriously.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>One Wild Rumor Suggests The Duggars Are Not At All What They Seem</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It seems that Josh Duggar's sentence has already been extended—meaning <a href=#>he won't be getting out of prison early</a> by any means—because he was allegedly in possession of contraband. Josh was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">put in solitary confinement</a> for nearly two months after his cell phone violation, according to The Sun.</p><p>It's likely safe to assume that Administrative Detention and Disciplinary Segregation refers to solitary confinement, but either way, Josh seems to have had the harshest punishment possible at the facility.</p><p>The other impacts of his rule-breaking include no visitors for six months, no phone calls for the same amount of time, and no commissary access either.</p><p>At this point, his time behind bars can only get longer if he continues to skirt the rules.</p><h2 id=could-josh-duggar-be-moved-to-a-different-correctional-institution>Could Josh Duggar Be Moved To A Different Correctional Institution?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/jd.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Given that he's gotten into trouble at his current low-security facility, it's worth wondering whether Josh Duggar could be moved somewhere more secure. Because of the crimes he's committed, he likely wouldn't be housed with the general population in the first place, but it's also possible that he's kept separate from other inmates for his own safety.</p><p>In a discussion over Duggar's extended sentence for possession of contraband, leaving him with an October 2032 release date, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Redditors had some thoughts</a>. A top-rated comment stated, "Imagine caring so little about your wife and kids that you can’t even keep your head down while in prison to get back to them faster."</p><p>The string of replies that followed pointed out that if Josh keeps up with breaking the rules, he might be sent somewhere more secure. In fact, they suggested, he probably already lost privileges because of rule violations.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>They Stopped Having Kids, But The Duggar Family Still Holds A Record</a></span></p><p>Some commenters who were more in-the-know thought it unlikely that Josh Duggar would ever be sent to a higher-level facility simply because his offenses are crimes against children. In general, one apparently knowledgeable commenter wrote, Duggar was likely to be shuffled to another prison or camp that holds more of the same type of offenders.</p><p>Another wrote, "He does need to worry about his safety, especially if he gets moved away from Seagoville. He is treating Seagoville like looking at a gift horse in the mouth. It would be sad if he wasn't so arrogant and believing he's above it all."</p><p>Various commenters were happy that Josh was messing up and earning more time behind bars, while others speculated that he "got lucky" in terms of his placement simply because of his family's ties. Some thought that Josh specifically <a href=#>took advantage of his family's power</a> and got placement at Seagoville so he could live as cushy a sentence as possible.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Unfortunately for him, a 'comfortable' sentence won't happen if he continues breaking rules.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYr2ztdKopWaho2K3sL%2FHZpuun5eWv261zWg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./olivia-jane-d-abo-married-boyfriend-husband-kids-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Olivia Jane d'Abo Married, Boyfriend, Husband, Kids, Net worth, Bio, Age</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./bryce-hall-height-revealed-how-tall-is-the-tiktok-star.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Bryce Hall Height Revealed; How Tall is The TikTok Star?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./worlds-smallest-and-richest-countries-worth-visiting.html>10 Of The World's Smallest And Richest Countries</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breakfast-eatery-dessert-shop-headed-downtown-rock-hill.html>Breakfast eatery, dessert shop headed to downtown Rock Hill WSOC TV</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1430237-shannon-moore-is-6-years-sober-credits-wwe-for-saving-his-life.html>Shannon Moore Is 6 Years Sober, Credits WWE For Saving His Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./laconic-crossword-clue-99949425.html>Laconic Crossword Clue - News</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lionel-messi-world-cup-argentina-final.html>Lionel Messi doesnt need the ball to hurt you</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JotBlog.
