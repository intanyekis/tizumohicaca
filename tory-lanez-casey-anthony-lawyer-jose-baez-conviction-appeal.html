Kenner plans to file a motion for a new trial that would toss the rapper’s three convictions.</p><p>“I look forward to litigating the motion for a new trial,” Kenner said at the hearing, according to <a href=# rel=noopener>Los Angeles Magazine</a>. He added: “We’re very confident.”</p><p></p><p>Tory Lanez (real name Daystar Peterson) was <a class=underline-link href=# rel=noopener>convicted on all three counts he was charged with</a> following a high-profile 10-day trial in Los Angeles last month.</p><p>He was found guilty of felony assault with a semiautomatic firearm, possession of a concealed, unregistered firearm and discharging a firearm with gross negligence.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>Jurors agreed with the prosecution’s theory that Tory <a class=underline-link href=# rel=noopener>fired five shots</a> at <a href=# rel=noopener>Megan Thee Stallion</a> in a fit of rage during a drunken dispute following a party at Kylie Jenner’s house in the Hollywood Hills in July 2020, <a class=underline-link href=# rel=noopener>wounding her feet</a>.</p><p>He faces a maximum of 22 years and eight months behind bars, as well as subsequent deportation to Canada.

Both my son, myself and others of our family have long decided that we are not going to hold any animosity against Megan Pete a.k.a. Megan Thee Stallion,” he said during a 40-minute video posted on Instagram last week. “We forgave that girl a long time ago. A long time ago.”</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>He added: “Some will no doubt actually question: is he actually saying that Tory forgave Megan for all of what’s going on? Yes, we have forgiven her. But what we will not back down from is the machine.”</p><p>Peterson — a former pastor — previously made headlines by <a class=underline-link href=# rel=noopener>angrily calling the court system “wicked” and two of the prosecutors “evil”</a> after Tory’s guilty verdict was announced, resulting in him being forcibly removed from the courtoom.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>He continued his tirade outside the courthouse, where he directed his anger at Megan’s attorney Alex Spiro, Roc Nation COO Desiree Perez, “and the whole wicked system of Roc Nation, including you, <a href=# rel=noopener>JAY-Z</a>.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmigmaW1sLzDsWWcp51ku6bD0mirqKqpYrmiusSzZJyZo5rGbq3NrZ%2BopqliuaLD2J6pZqKfqLJursCesWabn6PDqq%2FToqanZZGlvaatyw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-pete-arredondo-wikipedia-bio-and-personal-details-of-the-police-chief.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who Is Pete Arredondo?
