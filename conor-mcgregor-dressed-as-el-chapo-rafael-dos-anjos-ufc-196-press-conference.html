I’m dressed like 'El Chapo' in his prime. I’m running this company like half a wise guy. I’m up here verbally destroying this man.

Conor was doing that same pose and not telling anyone. Everybody had to figure out what Conor was doing," Rogan said on his podcast.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talksport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2022/07/GettyImages-505880474.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talksport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2020/09/Rogan.jpg><p></p><p>Rogan’s producer then pulled up footage of McGregor posing alongside dos Anjos as they compared it to El Chapo’s photograph with Penn.</p><p>“Look at him. Look at his face! He’s just a f****** animal. God damn, I love that guy. Come on man it’s pretty f****** close,” the 54-year-old added.</p><p>"It’s just the handshake thing. Conor is normally putting his fists in peoples’ faces and talking s*** and in that one, he looks like he’s going to shake hands.</p><p>“Look at that, it’s like the same thing. He’s holding his hand out and dos Anjos isn’t even thinking about holding his hand. Dana is going, ‘Oh my god.
