If you do, then it's easy to explain why almost everyone will go through a series of painful breakups before finally settling down with the right person.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If you donâ€™t believe there's a person made specifically for another person, then you believe every relationship has a chance of working out, the result will often depend on how much work the two parties put into it. Many people hold onto this belief as opposed to the former, although, everyone is free to have his or her opinion on the matter.</p><p>Lionel Messi married his beautiful wife, Antonella Roccuzzo, on June 30, 2017, in a very colorful ceremony in their hometown. What's interesting about these two is that they knew each other when Messi was just five years old, and by the time he was nine years old, he already knew he wanted to be with Roccuzzo.</p><p>Some people would argue just how lucky Roccuzzo must be, because she's Messi's sweetheart, and his heart is totally sold out to her. However, if you would ask Messi what he thought about his relationship with his wife, he would probably say he was the lucky one since she's such a beautiful woman and she loves him deeply. Here are 20 things about Messi that prove Roccuzzo hit the jackpot when she chose to stick with this&nbsp;soccer legend for life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=he-is-smarter-than-most-people><strong>He Is Smarter Than Most People</strong></h2><p>Have you ever watched <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lionel Messi</a> playing soccer? If you have, then you know he's a genius at the game, and even his haters would never deny this fact. One odd thing about him on the field is how he often likes to walk around when everyone else is running. However, when he appears to be taking it easy, he's being smart, and this strategy works every time.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Pep Guardiola</a>, one of the greatest coaches we have today,&nbsp;who had the privilege of coaching Messi for four years, Messi does the least amount of running in La Liga, despite being the best. He uses this strategy on the field to distance himself, and his opponents mistake the sign that he's not a threat at the time.</p><p>Guardiola explained during an interview how Messi's walking is a strategy he uses to x-ray every moment and to know everyone's position so he can strike when his opponents least expect him to.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=he-understands-his-game><strong>He Understands His Game</strong></h2><p>One of the great qualities about Messi is his level of understanding of soccer, a quality that makes him stand out from most other players in the game. Of course, he's a master ball handler, but he also knows so much concerning the technical team and his teammates that his knowledge came even as a surprise to Edgardo Bauza.&nbsp;Bauza is a former Argentine&nbsp;soccer player&nbsp;and one-time coach of the Argentine National Team.</p><p><strong>Many great players just concern themselves with their presence on the pitch and their performance in the game, but Messi goes beyond such knowledge and shows genuine concern for the entire team.</strong></p><p>Antonella Roccuzzo must be so lucky to have a husband who not only cares about himself but all the people involved in the game. This care and concern are evidence of just how caring he is to his wife and family because his family is the first and most important team he belongs to.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=he-s-an-inspiration-to-all><strong>He's An Inspiration To All</strong></h2><p>Five years ago, on April 11, the Independent ran an article with the heading "How Lionel Messi 'just being on the pitch' can inspire Barcelona to Champions League glory." This title says so much about Messi and his presence in the field, that you would want to read its contents to find out exactly what happened during the game to warrant such praise.</p><p>This article was about a Champions League game between Barcelona and Paris Saint-Germain (PSG), two of the best teams in Europe, and current league leaders in their respective countries. The chances of Messi playing in the game were very slim since he had suffered a hamstring injury in an earlier match.</p><p>Messi didn't start the game, he neither scored nor attempted to score, yet the team managed to come from behind and level the scores because Messi came into the game by replacing <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fabregas</a>. Being married to a man with such great influence is a great thing; Roccuzzo is one lucky girl.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=people-will-do-anything-just-to-say-hi-to-him><strong>People&nbsp;Will Do Anything Just To Say Hi To Him</strong></h2><p>Have you ever been in the company of a celebrity and had to witness the lengths other people go to just to take a selfie or an autograph? This behavior makes some celebrities so angry; they often have to hire security just to keep fans away from them. Although it might not be so easy to get to Messi and shake his hand, some people don't care about the consequences; they just go ahead and do&nbsp;questionable things to meet him.</p><p>In 2014, when Argentina was preparing for its first match of the FIFA World cup in Brazil, the Daily Mail wrote a story about a fan who invaded the pitch during their training session to say hi to Messi. The interesting thing about this pitch invasion was the resemblance the fan had with Brazilian superstar <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ronaldinho</a>.</p><p>Many people have run into the field before or after a game just to take a picture with or to say hi to Messi, only for stadium security to kick them out dishonorably moments later.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=he-s-good-to-his-fans><strong>He's Good To His Fans</strong></h2><p>Before ordinary people become famous, most crave attention for the things they do, especially the things they think are worth any form of praise. However, when nobodies eventually become famous and everyone starts digging deep into every small thing that they do, especially the private or even embarrassing things, the now celebrities start to hate the attention and to some extent, their fans.&nbsp;It's common for celebrities to mistreat their fans, but it's highly uncommon for Messi to mistreat or even disrespect a fan.</p><p><strong>After a game between Barcelona and Malaga in January 2016, a 15-year-old boy called Kevin ran into the field and hugged Messi, and as you would expect, security was hot on his trails. Before taking him away, Messi removed his shirt and gave it to the boy, who was so excited he would have probably kept the shirt in a safe and brag about it to all his friends.</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although Bleacher Report mentioned in their story that the security officers took the shirt away from Kevin, the act of kindness on Messi's part showed just how good he is to his fans.</p><h2 id=he-s-a-unicef-goodwill-ambassador><strong>He's a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador</strong></h2><p>Although she knew him when he was just a little boy, Roccuzzo was so fortunate to marry a man whose reputation worldwide was and continues to be nothing short of great. On March 11, 2010, Messi became a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador because he was and still is considered one of the best&nbsp;soccer players&nbsp;of this generation and the most respected.</p><p><strong>To become a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador, you have to be a prominent individual in the world of film, music, art, business, literature, or sport and have to have a passion for environmental and social issues. The people chosen to take up this noble responsibility are world changers and Messi fits the bill.</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This selection, among other qualities he has, is just a confirmation to his wife that she made an amazing choice. Having a reputable organization like UNICEF rooting for you is an awesome thing. Many women would love to fall in love with a man everyone out there knows is great.</p><h2 id=he-is-best-soccer-player-in-the-world><strong>He Is Best&nbsp;Soccer Player In The World</strong></h2><p>The greatest achievement an actor or an actress can achieve throughout his or her career is winning an Academy Award for Best Actor or Best Actress. Winning more than one is an even greater honor. In the world of soccer, the greatest award a player can achieve today is winning the Ballon dâ€™Or award.</p><p>The world's best player receives this award. Messi has received the award five times to date and is expected to win a few more times before he retires. In addition, Messi received the Golden Ball award for his outstanding performance in 2014's World Cup finals. Although we could never really predict which team will win this year's world cup in Russia, Messi's Argentina has a much greater chance of winning than most other qualifiers.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Being the best&nbsp;soccer player in the world requires commitment, endurance, a lot of practice, a desire to achieve greatness and teamwork. When you look at these qualities closely, you will discover most of them are essential in every successful relationship.</p><h2 id=he-overcame-growth-hormone-deficiency-to-become-the-best-in-the-world><strong>He Overcame Growth Hormone Deficiency To Become The Best In The World</strong></h2><p>All human beings are built with immeasurable skills, talents, and abilities, which are enough to make each of us a superstar. However, most people hardly even scratch the surface of the things they're capable of since many are fearful and the rest encounter challenges along the way.</p><p><strong>The most successful people in society are those who not only meet challenges many times and fail countless times, but they stand up every time and conquer their challenges. Messi is a great example of a superstar who had every reason to quit&nbsp;soccer but stuck to it and became the amazing player we know today.</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Telegraph published Messi's statement a few years ago, where he explained how at age 11, doctors discovered he was suffering from a growth hormone deficiency. He was always the smallest child in school and on the pitch and were it not for the corrective treatment he underwent, he wouldn't have been able to play the way he does. He used to stick needles in his legs every night for three years as treatment.</p><h2 id=he-knows-what-it-s-like-to-be-poor-and-to-be-wealthy><strong>He Knows What It's Like To Be Poor And To Be Wealthy</strong></h2><p>We've heard the countless stories of celebrities and businesspersons who rise from rags to riches, and a small percentage of the same, who end up losing all of it.&nbsp;It's concerning to see those fairytale stories of rags to riches&nbsp;end up back to rags again, and athletes are arguably the most affected group.</p><p><strong>Many athletes come from very humble backgrounds, and when they make millions over the course of their careers, some never learn how to manage their wealth properly and so end up as they were before. Others divorce their wives, get new girlfriends, and forget the people who helped them to get to the great heights they got to, and pretend to be people they're not.</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The great thing about Messi is he has tasted both lives, and as far as we can see, he's still the same person that he was when he didn't have all his wealth. Roccuzzo can be sure her man will never betray her or change and become like someone he's not because of his wealth.</p><h2 id=he-s-philanthropic><strong>He's Philanthropic</strong></h2><p>One of the amazing things about the wealthiest people in the world today is their willingness to lend a helping hand to the less fortunate in society. In October 2015, Business Insider published a story about billionaires, who had pledged to give away most of their wealth over their lifetime. Although the story mentioned just nine, so many more billionaires are pledging to keep giving towards charitable causes, with others pledging to give 99% of their wealth.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One way to identify someone who has a really good heart is his or her willingness to give. Messi might not be a billionaire, but he sure knows how to give towards charitable causes. Although the whole world gets to know whenever he scores a goal, most people never get to know just how charitable he is. For example, The Leo Messi Foundation was involved in Syria, helping to build over 20 classrooms and helping to restore the lives of the over 1600 children affected by war. The foundation has participated in numerous charitable activities around the world.</p><h2 id=he-has-a-ton-of-cash><strong>He&nbsp;Has&nbsp;A Ton Of Cash</strong></h2><p>Although the amount of money a man has should never determine how ladies should respond to him, it does. It's common to see very old and wrinkly old men or selfish and rude men, both of whom are a pain to be around, with extremely hot women flocking around them just because they're rich. According to Forbes, Messi is the third highest-paid athlete in the world, taking home approximately $80 million every year.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Therefore, you can imagine how happy a woman is when she has a handsome and rich gentleman to call her own. Roccuzzo falls into a category of special women who would claim to have gotten everything they would desire in their men and no one would question her claims.</p><p>Being married to a rich husband means that she can wear whatever jewelry she wants, drive any car she wants, live in any house she desires, and even go on luxurious holidays, all without worrying about the cost. It's like she married a prince because she's truly a princess.</p><h2 id=he-s-a-great-role-model><strong>He's A Great Role Model</strong></h2><p>Is the person you're in a relationship with considered a role model in any capacity? If not, you have a reason to be worried. Being a role model means having at least one individual looking up to you because he or she would love to be like you one day.</p><p><strong>If you would ask any young and upcoming&nbsp;soccer player who their role model was, the chances are, they'd tell you they'd love to be like Messi. With so many positive and admirable character qualities, in addition to his amazing&nbsp;soccer&nbsp;skills, Messi has touched the lives of millions of fans out there.</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to The Odyssey, Messi is a great role model because of how he overcame his health challenges, how he remains humble yet so successful, his loyalty to his wife, and his professionalism both on the pitch and in life. Roccuzzo was lucky to win the heart of the man who millions of teenagers would love to emulate.</p><h2 id=he-s-faithful-to-her><strong>He's Faithful To Her</strong></h2><p>One of the worst things you can do to the person you love or claim to love is to betray his or her trust by becoming unfaithful to him or her. Although being faithful isn't the only thing a relationship needs to survive, it's arguably at the top of every woman's list.</p><p>According to Sport English, Messi and Roccuzzo began spending time in 1996 when he and Lucas Scaglia would play&nbsp;soccer along the shores of the Parana River. At this time, Messi was already in love with her, since he would write letters stating she would one day be his girlfriend. In 2009, Messi was asked about having a girlfriend and thatâ€™s the first time the whole world knew about his relationship with her.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As far as we know, Messi has remained faithful to Roccuzzo since their childhood years and continues to be so even today. Even with his rise to stardom and the love people show him, including women, Messi has kept his focus on his woman, which is one of the most valuable things a man can do to a woman.</p><h2 id=he-s-a-great-dad><strong>He's A Great Dad</strong></h2><p>Although Messi tries to live a quiet and reserved lifestyle off the pitch, he has let us into his personal life on social media when he talks about his sons. Messi has three children so far, Thiago was born in 2012, Mateo was born 2015 and Ciro was born just this year.</p><p><strong>Messi has taken time off from his team to attend the births of his children and has shared the information with the world through social media.</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In an interview with The Sun, Messi revealed that his eldest son, Thiago, loves playing soccer&nbsp;and is a phenomenal player, while Mateo at the time was terrible at it, although he was still too young.&nbsp;In addition to loving his woman, women love a man who can love their children deeply and always be there for them. When a man loves his children deeply, they get to experience the value of having a father figure in their lives, and chances are they will also love their children the same way their father loved them.</p><h2 id=he-s-humble-and-respectful><strong>He's Humble And Respectful</strong></h2><p>Last year, towards the end of March, in an interview published on FourFourTwo, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cesc Fabregas</a> talked about what he thought about Messi, and it was nothing but praise and respect. Fabregas, who used to be his teammate in Barcelona but currently plays for Chelsea stated how impressive Messi was for remaining humble despite being so successful.</p><p>Having won so many Ballon d'Or trophies, Champion League titles, La Liga championship titles, and other trophies and still remaining so humble is enough reason to applaud him. Furthermore, his relationship with his wife, his children, and his fans is something deserving of praise, because he treats them all with so much love and respect.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>To receive such praise from amazing professional players is a great thing and its music to Roccuzzo's ears. A humble man will always treat his woman in a humane and respectful way, and to marry such a man is a great privilege. She sure hit the jackpot with Messi.</p><h2 id=he-s-handsome><strong>He's Handsome</strong></h2><p>Arguably, outer beauty matters more to men than it does to women, because according to Net Nanny, in men vision is their most dominant perception whereas a woman's senses are finely tuned. Therefore, a woman will find a man to be attractive based on a number of factors including how he makes her feel, the words he uses when talking to her, and the gifts he gives her.</p><p>However, this in no way means women don't care about how a man looks, because it contributes to their overall perception of how attractive the man is and whether she wants a deeper connection with him.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Roccuzzo is a very lucky woman because, in addition to having a man who loves her and is faithful to her, he looks good. Many extremely beautiful women who get into relationships with rich men who most people would consider ugly are accused of being gold-diggers, an accusation no sane individual would place on Roccuzzo.</p><h2 id=people-everywhere-love-and-respect-him><strong>People Everywhere Love And Respect Him</strong></h2><p>Have you ever spent time with the wife of a convicted felon, whether her husband was still in prison or got out? These women struggle with the feeling that people are judging them for their husband's actions, whether their husbands were guilty or not. Many of these women carry this burden for a long time and the whole situation stretches their relationship to the point of thinking how life would have been different had they not met their husbands.</p><p>On the other hand, women like Roccuzzo go through a completely different set of feelings because people everywhere love and respect their husbands. This feeling towards the man she has chosen to spend the rest of her life with makes it easy for her to love and cherish him even more.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In February 2016, Eurosport compiled a few quotes from big sports stars such as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Samuel Eto'o</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Pele</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kobe Bryant</a>, Romario, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Zinedine Zidane</a>, and more, and all they had to say was how Messi was a gift from God.</p><h2 id=the-whole-world-knows-he-loves-her><strong>The Whole World Knows He Loves Her</strong></h2><p>One of the biggest problems the women dating famous men face is knowing for sure whether the famous men love them or are proud to be seen with them. It's common for successful athletes to try to keep a low profile when it comes to their love life, and often fail to come clean concerning the identity of the women they're dating.</p><p><strong>This is hardly the case with Messi because since as far back as we can remember, Roccuzzo has always been Messi's significant other and the whole world has always known the identity of the woman who has his heart.</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Furthermore, on June 30, 2017, these two got married in Rosario at Hotel City Center Hotel, in a wedding termed by Argentina's ClarÃ­n newspaper as the wedding of the year and the wedding of the century. When the couple came out to meet the press as husband and wife, these had an awkward first kiss in front of cameras as husband and wife. Many described the kiss to be messy.</p><h2 id=he-has-great-fashion-taste><strong>He Has Great Fashion Taste</strong></h2><p>Fashion is one of the most fluid concepts in society because you'll find that one day ripped jeans are fashionable but by the next day, they're not. Trying to keep up with fashion trends can be exhausting, especially if you're trying to do so on a tight budget. The only people who can truly keep up with fashion are celebrities who have personal wardrobe managers who donâ€™t have an upper limit as to how much they can spend dressing their clients.</p><p><strong>Some people have questioned Messi's fashion choices over the years, but what they fail to realize is the power he has over the fashion world. People like Messi are the ones who have the power to influence all who look up to him to wear whatever they do, simply because to them, he can do no wrong.</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Therefore, when he wears a polka-dot suit, a fashion-forward shepherd jumper, or Speedos to the beach, we can only admire him and look for the same items of clothing on the market. Besides, he genuinely has a great fashion sense.</p><h2 id=he-has-so-much-love-for-his-family><strong>He Has&nbsp;So Much Love For His Family</strong></h2><p>When a woman accepts her lover's hand in marriage, one of the things that freak her out the most is the in-laws.
