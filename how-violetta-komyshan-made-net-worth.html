According to The Cut, in June 2020, a Twitter user who claimed to be a fan of Elgort accused him of assaulting her in 2014. She said that after meeting on Snapchat, Elgort (who was 20 at the time) and the anonymous accuser (who was 17) exchanged messages which led to a personal encounter, where Elgort coerced her intimacy. Elgort has denied the allegations, but the damage seems to have already been done to their relationship.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9dq7awuMStq5plm6S6ur%2FHmqVmpZGZsm66xK1ksKeiqbVw</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./pedro-gallese-facts-bio-wiki-net-worth-age-height-salary-current-team-transfer-goalkeeper-nationality-contract-affair-wife-career-news.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Pedro Gallese Facts Bio, Wiki, Net Worth, Age, Height, Salary, Current Team, Transfer, Goalkeepe</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./did-halloween-star-jamie-lee-curtis-really-have-her-legs-insured.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Did Halloween Star Jamie Lee Curtis Really Have Her Legs Insured?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./worlds-smallest-and-richest-countries-worth-visiting.html>10 Of The World's Smallest And Richest Countries</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breakfast-eatery-dessert-shop-headed-downtown-rock-hill.html>Breakfast eatery, dessert shop headed to downtown Rock Hill WSOC TV</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1430237-shannon-moore-is-6-years-sober-credits-wwe-for-saving-his-life.html>Shannon Moore Is 6 Years Sober, Credits WWE For Saving His Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./laconic-crossword-clue-99949425.html>Laconic Crossword Clue - News</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lionel-messi-world-cup-argentina-final.html>Lionel Messi doesnt need the ball to hurt you</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JotBlog.
