Domestic abuse is never, ever funny. These are real issues with real people and I REALLY regret my actions. In the future I will do better. I’m so sorry.”</p><p>Hampshire deleted <a href=# rel=noopener>photos of herself</a> dressed as Depp, 60, complete with drawn-on tattoos and accessories that referenced the actor’s <a href=#>2022 defamation case</a> against his ex-wife Heard, 37. Hampshire’s pal feigned tears in the snaps and donned a white top reminiscent of the one Heard wore when she <a href=#>cried on the stand</a> in May 2022.</p><p>A plastic turd could be seen in Hampshire’s jacket pocket, a nod to Depp’s claim that he <a href=#>discovered “human fecal matter”</a> on his bed in 2016 following a fight with Heard. The Canadian actress also posed with a bottle of wine, which some social media users interpreted as a reference to Heard’s claim that Depp sexually assaulted her with a liquor bottle in 2015.</p><p>“Wow. This is obviously in poor taste but the wine bottle prop? Gross,” one Reddit user wrote.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Schitt-s-Creek-s-Emily-Hampshire-Apologizes-for-Johnny-Depp-and-Amber-Heard-Hallowen-Costume-782.jpg><p>Others felt that the time for the controversial costume had come and gone as a <a href=#>jury ruled in favor of Depp</a> in June 2022, awarding him $10 million in compensatory damages and $5 million in punitive damages.</p><p>“It really is a special kind of depraved to keep the costumes going a full year and a half later. @emilyhampshire clearly felt the need to rise to the task,” one X (formerly Twitter) user wrote.</p><p>Another person shared a similar sentiment via Reddit. “Well, this is insanely disappointing. Also, even if it weren’t offensive, this costume is so late to the party,” they wrote.</p><p>Depp first <a href=#>sued Heard</a>, whom he was married to from 2015 to 2017, in February 2019 over her December 2018 op-ed in The Washington Post. Heard described herself as a domestic violence survivor in the piece, but didn’t mention Depp by name.</p><p>After the jury ruled in Depp’s favor, the actor <a href=#>shared a lengthy statement</a> noting that he was “truly humbled” to have his “life back.” He concluded the message with, “Truth never perishes.”</p><p>Depp’s legal victory came three years after a <a href=#>judge ruled against him</a> during his 2020 libel lawsuit against The Sun. (Depp sued the U.K. publication over an April 2018 story which cited allegations Heard had previously made detailing 14 different instances of abuse.) The judge ruled in October 2020 that The Sun’s claims against Depp were “substantially true.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Depp and Heard officially <a href=#>settled their defamation lawsuit</a> in December 2022, which the Aquaman actress called “a very difficult decision” in an Instagram statement at the time.</p><p>“It’s important for me to say that I never chose this. I defended my truth and in doing so my life as I knew it was destroyed,” Heard wrote, calling “the vilification [she] faced on social media” an “amplified version of the ways in which women are re-victimised when they come forward.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGasm5iewbW%2FjJypnp2bqHqmucilsGagkaK9tLTIq5xmmaCkubCzyLOcrGWWpL9uts6hpaexXZmysbyMnKasrKWisnA%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./top-10-all-time-ncaa-basketball-scoring-leaders.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Top 10 All-Time NCAA Basketball Scoring Leaders</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./salaries-of-state-of-iowa-employees.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Salaries of State of Iowa Employees Earnings and Hourly Wages</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./worlds-smallest-and-richest-countries-worth-visiting.html>10 Of The World's Smallest And Richest Countries</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breakfast-eatery-dessert-shop-headed-downtown-rock-hill.html>Breakfast eatery, dessert shop headed to downtown Rock Hill WSOC TV</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1430237-shannon-moore-is-6-years-sober-credits-wwe-for-saving-his-life.html>Shannon Moore Is 6 Years Sober, Credits WWE For Saving His Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./laconic-crossword-clue-99949425.html>Laconic Crossword Clue - News</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lionel-messi-world-cup-argentina-final.html>Lionel Messi doesnt need the ball to hurt you</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JotBlog.
