The 2019 ATP Finals&nbsp;champion&nbsp;currently has a career-high ranking of No. 3 in the world,&nbsp;making him the highest-ranked Greek player in history.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>He is also the&nbsp;youngest player ranked in the top 10 by the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP), with&nbsp;seven ATP singles titles to his name.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>During a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">recent interview with Vogue</a>,&nbsp;Tsitsipas expressed that&nbsp;he is all grown up now and&nbsp;prefers not to be called&nbsp;a boy anymore — a man, maybe? <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Parents' Involvement in His Life</h2><p>In Vogue's August 2021 interview, the pro tennis star talked about attaining&nbsp;manhood and how his parents' involvement in his life bothered him in recent years.</p><p>Tsitsipas implied that with his growing age, he was also&nbsp;evolving into his own person,&nbsp;trying on new hobbies and&nbsp;habits to find out what suits him.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>"I’m a grown-up now," the 23-year-old said. "I’m not a boy anymore. When I turned 21, I felt like, you know, things have changed." <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The interview also brought into light his post-match press conference from&nbsp;last year, where Tsitsipas confessed that he sometimes felt like his parents were too&nbsp;involved in his life.</p><p>Surprisingly, his mother&nbsp;Julia Apostoli, a former&nbsp;professional tennis player,&nbsp;showed up&nbsp;at his next press conference and&nbsp;playfully tossed a question from the back row, saying,</p><p>Hi, Stef; now I’m following you to the press conference to make sure I’m aware how you feel.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Just in case you didn't know, Tsitsipas was born in a <a href=# rel=follow>tennis</a> family, with his mother being a former WTA player, while his father Apostolos Tsitsipas is trained as a tennis coach. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>But with what&nbsp;Tsitsipas said, he wants his parents to be less concerned about him&nbsp;since he hopes to explore his life independently.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><h2>Finding Time for Graphic Design</h2><p>While the former world No. 1 junior talked about trying new hobbies, he also shared one with the publication. He disclosed that he&nbsp;was finding time to get into graphic design and creating his own font.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>Addressing how unusual it is for a professional athlete of his caliber to invest time in&nbsp;extracurricular talents and sundry passions, he said the growth in him starts from outside the tennis court, and "then&nbsp;it goes into my tennis." <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Girlfriend&nbsp;Upgraded His Wardrobe</h2><p>In between learning new things and performing day in&nbsp;day out on the&nbsp;tennis court,&nbsp;Tsitsipas also makes time for his girlfriend&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>Theodora Petalas</a>,&nbsp;a New York University alum. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Despite having a long-distance relationship, he credited his girlfriend, whom he has known&nbsp;for the last three years, for helping to pick new outfits for him.</p><p>"My wardrobe was quite weak, and I didn’t have a game there," he told Vogue. "I wanted to start dressing up a bit, so we tried to create an identity."</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Now, with her help, he believes he has an improved wardrobe, filled with "earthy colors,"&nbsp;not&nbsp;too flashy, and&nbsp;refined but youthful outfits.</p><p>He further said he&nbsp;had started investing more&nbsp;in fashion lately, with the help of his girlfriend, and that&nbsp;transition&nbsp;benefitted him a lot and made him feel better about himself.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKukmrOius6sZK2rmanAqrzArGSgoaKhs7O1xKebZqiRp7KvwNJnn62lnA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./cole-haan-winter-coat-quilted-puffer-parker-sale.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The Sale Price on This Warm Cole Haan Puffer Coat Is Majorly Hot</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./peter-holt-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Peter Holt Net Worth | TheRichest</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./worlds-smallest-and-richest-countries-worth-visiting.html>10 Of The World's Smallest And Richest Countries</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breakfast-eatery-dessert-shop-headed-downtown-rock-hill.html>Breakfast eatery, dessert shop headed to downtown Rock Hill WSOC TV</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1430237-shannon-moore-is-6-years-sober-credits-wwe-for-saving-his-life.html>Shannon Moore Is 6 Years Sober, Credits WWE For Saving His Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./laconic-crossword-clue-99949425.html>Laconic Crossword Clue - News</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lionel-messi-world-cup-argentina-final.html>Lionel Messi doesnt need the ball to hurt you</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JotBlog.
