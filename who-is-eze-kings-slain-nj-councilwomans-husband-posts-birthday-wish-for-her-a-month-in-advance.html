Dwumfour's husband works as a pastor and identifies himself by the name Eze Kings on the social media site.</p><p>“4th March is your birthday happy glorious birthday in addy my love,” wrote Dwumfour’s husband. He attached almost a dozen photos of the couple which specifically showed Dwumfour’s wedding ring and also added a series of hearts in the post. The bizarre post has almost 150 comments, many of which expressed shock and disbelief at<a href=# rel> Dwumfour’s tragic death</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>READ MORE</strong></p><p><a href=# rel>California shooting: Noah David Beard and Angel Uriarte arrested for killing 6, including teen mom and 10-month-old boy</a></p><p><a href=# rel>Amir Locke death: Civil lawsuit filed a year after Minneapolis cops shot man, 22, in no-knock search warrant</a></p><h2 class=split><strong>What happened to Eunice Dwumfour?</strong></h2><p>An unknown gunman shot Dwumfour multiple times while she drove her white Nissan near the Camelot at the La Mer apartment complex. Authorities later arrived at the scene and pronounced her dead. Neither local police nor the <a href=# rel>Middlesex County</a> Prosecutor’s Office has come up with the name of any suspects, but according to the reports of &nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">ABC7</a> in New York, investigators are looking into her ties to her husband’s church overseas in Nigeria, among other things.</p><p>The outlet said that police dogs were brought by the authorities to search the woods behind the apartment complex for the murder weapon. Neighbors alleged that they have seen the killer run toward the nearby Garden State Parkway.&nbsp;</p><p>According to<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> New York Post</a>, police claimed that the councilwoman was caught speaking to the killer just moments prior to her death. The family of the New York native said that they are cooperating with the local authorities as they probe to find out what happened on that night. “I can’t say anything about it unless [the investigation] is finished,” said Prince Dwumfour, the councilwoman’s father.&nbsp;</p><p>He paused and added, "All these things you’re asking, it will come out eventually," when was asked about when Dwumfour’s absent husband would be coming. The police department said that the investigation is still ongoing and they won't release any further details as of now.&nbsp;</p><p>One family friend who lives in the same apartment as Dwumfour’s parents, claims that Dwumfour might have been a victim of a racially motivated attack. “We all suggested that she doesn’t move down to that part of Jersey — we call that ‘clan land,’” said the friend, who would not give her name. “That was a hit. That was an assassination.”&nbsp;</p><p>Amos Martey, 52 who is another family friend from Ghana also believes that she was killed because of her race and position. “I believe color played a role,” Martey said. “I believe because she’s a minority. It might be related to her job … I might be wrong, but that’s how I feel. It breaks my heart.”&nbsp;</p><p>On Friday, February 3, the FBI's Newark field office issued a statement, saying that they were aware of Dwumfour’s death and were in contact with local law enforcement. “Should they ask us for any assistance, we will do all we can to help their investigation,” a spokesperson said in an email. The Republican councilwoman was the oldest of five children in a Ghanaian family and was the mother of an 11-year-old girl.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=split>Who is Eze Kings?</h2><p>Although not much is known about Eze Kings, the husband of the late councilwoman reportedly works as a pastor in Nigeria. It is also not known if Eze Kings is his real name or not. Kings married Dwumfour in November last year in Africa, according to her relatives.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRor5ikeqq%2FjJ6xnmWbnruov4yso5qhnmK7q3nCqKynm5mhxLC5wKeqZqClqK%2BiusNmp6irpKh6o7XRrZ%2BdmalixKq%2Fx2adqKpdnbKzecBmpKimpJ16qrqMmpuvmZ6Ysg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./yoovidhya-family-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Yoovidhya Family Net Worth | TheRichest</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./ryan-long-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-303016-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Ryan Long Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./worlds-smallest-and-richest-countries-worth-visiting.html>10 Of The World's Smallest And Richest Countries</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breakfast-eatery-dessert-shop-headed-downtown-rock-hill.html>Breakfast eatery, dessert shop headed to downtown Rock Hill WSOC TV</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1430237-shannon-moore-is-6-years-sober-credits-wwe-for-saving-his-life.html>Shannon Moore Is 6 Years Sober, Credits WWE For Saving His Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./laconic-crossword-clue-99949425.html>Laconic Crossword Clue - News</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lionel-messi-world-cup-argentina-final.html>Lionel Messi doesnt need the ball to hurt you</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JotBlog.
