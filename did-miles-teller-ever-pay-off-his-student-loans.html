While Jonah's career skyrocketed after the 2016 movie, Miles's career took a different turn. This was particularly surprising given the fact that he had been seen as one of the most sought-after actors of his generation up until that point. Few have his charisma and authenticity. But he hit a bit of a slump which he seems to be fully recovering from. His IMDb page is exploding with upcoming credits, including the new Top Gun film.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Miles' success may have been surprising for some people in his life. After all, he didn't come from money and actually had to do what many students do to get by... take out a loan. But a few years ago, Miles revealed that he hadn't paid off his massive student loan despite becoming famous. So, has he finally gotten that weight off his shoulders in 2022?</p><h2 id=when-did-miles-teller-graduate-high-school>When Did Miles Teller Graduate High School?</h2><p>Prior to his college years, Miles Teller went to high school in Lecanto, Florida. He was originally born in a suburb of Philadelphia but his family soon moved down to Florida for work.</p><ul><li><strong>Miles' mother, Merry, is a realtor and his father, Michael, is a nuclear power plant engineer.

This is where he got a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree.</p><ul><li><strong>Miles Teller got his scars in 2007 after a horrific car accident.</strong><strong>"I got ejected out the window of a car that flipped and rolled, going 80 miles an hour. We flipped eight times. When the car stopped rolling, I was 30 feet from it, unconscious, covered in blood," Miles said in an interview with Vulture.</strong></li></ul><p>Miles seems to be the type who has used a lot of his experiences in his work. So, there's no doubt that every school he went to gave him a little bit of something. But attending New York University gave him something he probably didn't want... debt. This is because he was working as a server at the time to make ends meet and simply couldn't afford to follow his dreams without taking out a student loan.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=has-miles-teller-paid-off-his-student-loans>Has Miles Teller Paid Off His Student Loans?</h2><p>During <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">an interview with Vulture in 2014</a>, Miles revealed that he racked up a whopping $100,000 in student loans while pursuing his dream at New York University's Tisch School of the Arts. Despite being in several successful projects before 2014, such as Project X, Footloose, the critically acclaimed Rabbit Hole (which broke him into the business), and a lead role in The Spectacular Now with h<a href=#>is friend Shailene Woodley</a>, Miles still hadn't paid off the $100,000.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At the time of the interview, Miles was promoting That Awkward Moment as well as Whiplash, which is seen as one of his best and most profitable films. This launched him on a trajectory of becoming one of the most successful actors of his generation. That is until he hit a slump where many wondered <a href=#>if he had been canceled by Hollywood</a> for some of the things he's said and done.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Miles Teller Reveals He’s Vaccinated Following Taylor Swift Music Video Release</a></span></p><p>In 2015, when Miles was very much at the top of his game and part of several blockbuster movies, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he was interviewed by Vulture once again</a> and revealed that he still hadn't paid off his debt.</p><p>"My business manager says the interest is so low, there’s no sense in paying them off," Miles admitted to Vulture.

In the spring of 2021, Miles was jumped in a bathroom in Hawaii by two men. One of them appeared to be married to a wedding planner who told TMZ that Miles owed her company a whopping $60,000.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, Keleigh took to social media to dispel the rumors, saying they were "completely false", and that the dispute was not over money and the rumors were "completely false". In fact, she claimed that these men have done stuff like this to others in the past.</p><p>But since June 2021, the somewhat strange story vanished. There's simply no new information about what really transpired and why. Simultaneously, there really doesn't appear to be any evidence to suggest Miles owed them money in the first place.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Here’s How Jax Taylor Found Himself $1.2 Million In Debt</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibopxdoratsdJmq56knJq%2FbrHVnqlmqJGuerCyxWafoqtdqMG2sMSnq2akn5a7tHs%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jj-da-boss-wiki-married-wife-family-net-worth-age-children.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>JJ Da Boss Wiki, Bio, Wife, Children, Net worth, Age, Family!</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-andreas-huber-meet-susan-lucci-and-helmut-huber-son.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who Is Andreas Huber?
