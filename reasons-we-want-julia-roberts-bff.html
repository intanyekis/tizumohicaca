She’s talented, smart, compassionate, driven and down-to-earth, and has been able to achieve crazy accomplishments just with hard work. How could you not&nbsp;want to be friends with this woman?</p><p>A lot of people think of Julia Roberts and envision an enviable smile, hearty laugh, timeless beauty, and the boots she wore in Pretty Woman. While she has all of that going for her, there is so much more to this movie star. Keep reading to find out 10 reasons why we want Julia Roberts to be our BFF!</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The 10 Richest Female Singers In 2019</a></span></p><h2 id=she-s-bounced-back-from-a-lot-of-criticism>She’s Bounced Back From A Lot Of Criticism</h2><p>Julia Roberts is much more than just a talented actress. She’s also a role model as a person, which is why we want her to be our BFF. One of the traits that makes her a role model and all-round admirable human being is the way she’s handled being in the spotlight.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Labeled as America’s Sweetheart early in her career, Roberts has had to deal with people saying all kinds of things about her. Just about everything she does is criticized. And yet, she still gets on with her life and holds her head up. Super inspiring!</p><h2 id=she-cares-about-the-world>She Cares About The World</h2><p>With the state that the world is in at the moment, we wouldn’t be interested in being anybody’s BFF if they didn’t care about the planet. But Julia Roberts does care about the planet and the people living on it! She has been involved with all kinds of charities since first rising to fame and is showing no signs of slowing down.</p><p>In the 1990s, she served as the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador to Haiti</a>. For her 49thbirthday, she asked her fans to donate to support LGBTQ youth rather than buying her presents.</p><h2 id=she-s-an-amazing-mom>She’s An Amazing Mom</h2><p>There are so many more reasons why Julia Roberts is a fantastic role model and they’re all reasons why we’d love to be her friend. Aside from being an amazing actress and humanitarian, Roberts is also a pretty great mom.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Every Cast Member Of The Crown's Net Worth</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite having access to every luxury on this planet, Roberts has said multiple times how much her greatest joy comes from being a mom. And since giving birth to the twins, Phinnaeus and Hazel, and her son Henry, they have been her top focus. She even moved away from Hollywood to give them a chance at a more normal life.</p><h2 id=she-brought-us-pretty-woman>She Brought Us Pretty Woman</h2><p>Need we say more? Julia Roberts brought us Pretty Woman. This is why we would give anything to be besties with her! Although not perfect, this rom-com quickly became a favorite of anyone who grew up in the 1990s. Now, Roberts and Richard Gere both have our gratitude, no matter what they go on to do.</p><p>We also don’t think anybody could have played the role of Vivian Ward quite like Roberts did. With that on-screen charisma, her wit, and her chemistry with Gere, she turned the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">movie into an icon</a>.</p><h2 id=and-several-other-hits>And Several Other Hits</h2><p>We’re still pining after Pretty Woman, even after all these years, but that’s definitely not the only movie Julia Roberts has ever brought us that has made us fall in love with her. On the contrary, she’s starred in <a href=#>several other hits</a> that have special places in our hearts.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Notting Hill, anyone? Roberts was just a girl standing in front of a boy asking him to love her. Or Erin Brockovich? We’re forever grateful to the actress for relaying the important story of Erin Brockovich and showing us what women can achieve when they put their minds to it.</p><h2 id=you-can-relate-to-her>You Can Relate To Her</h2><p>You’d think that after all her success, <a href=#>wealth</a>, and title of America’s Sweetheart, Julia Roberts would be somewhat unrelatable. But as it turns out, the star is totally relatable! And that’s just another reason why we love her. Watching interviews with Roberts, it already feels like she’s our BFF.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>This Is Us: Every Cast Member's Net Worth</a></span></p><p>While talking to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Today Show</a>, Roberts joked, “Usually the triumph of my day is everybody making it to the potty.” She seems to be more concerned with real things that people can relate to rather than red carpets and private jets.</p><h2 id=she-s-a-pioneer-for-women-s-rights>She’s A Pioneer For Women’s Rights</h2><p>It’s hard not to admire anyone who’s a pioneer for women’s rights. Just by being herself, Roberts has helped to pave the way for young women who want to achieve something in their lives. They see how successful she has been by relying on her talent and hard work.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">BuzzFeed </a>puts it, Roberts was also the first woman to earn $20 million for a movie. That came when she did Erin Brockovich in 2000. She worked hard to get there and showed young girls that women are worth exactly what men are worth.</p><h2 id=she-s-super-smart>She’s Super Smart</h2><p>It seems like Julia Roberts is one of those lucky souls who has everything! In addition to talent, drive, emotional intelligence, compassion, and looks, she’s also super smart. You can tell, if not from what she says in interviews, then from the way she banters with people on social media.</p><p>When people attack Roberts on platforms such as Instagram, she is quick to defend herself and always wins the argument using her wit. She’s not lacking in intelligence or self-confidence, which is rare. Who wouldn’t want to be her friend?</p><h2 id=we-could-listen-to-her-laughing-all-day>We Could Listen To Her Laughing All Day</h2><p>There’s one huge reason why we would love to be BFF with Julia Roberts: her laugh. Anybody who’s heard her laugh, whether in life or in her movies, knows that it is totally infectious and a gift in itself. She’s the type of person that would have you laughing all day with her!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Roberts also has the warmest smile which has become iconic throughout the years. We also feel like we’d always be smiling in her presence because it’s basically impossible to not smile back when you a smile like hers!</p><h2 id=the-immense-talent>The Immense Talent</h2><p>We’ll just say it. Julia Roberts is immensely talented. We would want to spend time with her just to admire her talent, possibly learn a thing or two from her, and hope that some of her natural abilities rub off on us!</p><p>You can see from the movies she’s appeared in that Roberts has a huge range, from playing hopeless romantics to super angry and driven characters. She exudes charisma on the screen and it’s easy to see why audiences across the world have fallen in love with her and her characters.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>10 Top Richest Actors In The World From 2009 To 2019</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmqaegYrC2uNOuqZ5nopqutLvNrGSwnV2srq%2FAjKOspaGRYr%2BwrsSrq6xlkpuzcA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./celebrities-paid-next-nothing-iconic-role.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>9 Times A-Listers Were Paid Next to Nothing for Iconic Roles</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./roger-moore-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Roger Moore Net Worth | TheRichest</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./worlds-smallest-and-richest-countries-worth-visiting.html>10 Of The World's Smallest And Richest Countries</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breakfast-eatery-dessert-shop-headed-downtown-rock-hill.html>Breakfast eatery, dessert shop headed to downtown Rock Hill WSOC TV</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1430237-shannon-moore-is-6-years-sober-credits-wwe-for-saving-his-life.html>Shannon Moore Is 6 Years Sober, Credits WWE For Saving His Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./laconic-crossword-clue-99949425.html>Laconic Crossword Clue - News</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lionel-messi-world-cup-argentina-final.html>Lionel Messi doesnt need the ball to hurt you</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JotBlog.
