Drake completed his high fashion slash couture ensemble with a unique Dior Oblique Saddle purse and flashy Chrome Hearts sunglasses.</p><h2 id=custom-chrome-hearts-denim-ensemble-100-000><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Custom Chrome Hearts Denim Ensemble: $100,000</span></h2><p>In 2020, the LA-based label Chrome Hearts crafted Drake a one-of-a-kind denim jumpsuit with embroidered Chrome Hearts logos. Chrome Hearts' characteristic dagger and cross graphics adorned the handcrafted denim jacket, pants, and cap that matched perfectly.</p><p>Drake's one-of-a-kind outfit, featuring high-end Japanese denim clothes and an absurd number of hand stitched decorations, likely cost him more than $100,000. The pricey and exclusive label, <a href=#>known for its limited edition</a>, gothic-inspired accessories and clothing, created everything especially for him.</p><h2 id=custom-chrome-hearts-leather-jacket-150-000><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Custom Chrome Hearts Leather Jacket: $150,000</span></h2><p>Drake asked the Los Angeles company Chrome Hearts to make a unique black leather jacket tailored to his taste.

Murakami painted the black leather jacket himself in his trademark colorful flower motif, covering the whole back and arms of the jacket in vivid, multicolored flowers.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Moreover, as the flower designs are one of Murakami's most famous works and very seldom painted onto clothing, that was the perfect pairing for the collaboration between the two masters. The one-of-a-kind collaborative piece between Drake, Murakami, and Louis Vuitton was most likely sold at around $200,000, considering the artist hand-painted each jacket.</p><p>At the Toronto International Film Festival 2018, Drake wore a custom OVO x Murakami varsity jacket, showing the merging of street wear and fine art, representing the avant-garde fashion sense of Drake and how he would team up with different hip-hop artists.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmmmWcpLysecCtZJ2qkaCytHnMqKqtZZWtvaa60qKtnmWfqsGntdOsZg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./an-inside-look-at-beyonce-and-solange-knowles-relationship.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>An Inside Look At Beyonc And Solange Knowles' Relationship</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-are-brad-james-kids-meet-his-keshia-knight-pulliam-family-and-net-worth-2.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who are Brad James Kids?
