Davis also alleged to <a href=#>The Times</a> that <a href=#>the actor screamed at her for being late</a> while she was waiting on wardrobe. He allegedly kept yelling at the Oscar winner from her trailer to set.</p><p>“That was bad. The way he behaved at the first meeting,” the Massachusetts native told the outlet during an interview on Friday, October 7. “I should have walked out of that or profoundly defended myself, in which case I wouldn’t have got the part.”</p><p>Davis starred as Murray’s <a href=#>onscreen girlfriend in the 1990 crime drama</a>. The movie, which is based on the novel of the same name by <strong>Jay Cronley</strong>, also featured <strong>Randy Quaid</strong>, <strong>Jason Robards</strong> and <a href=#><strong>Stanley Tucci</strong></a>.</p><p>The Beetlejuice actress explained that <a href=#>she had regrets about the situation</a>. “I could have avoided that treatment if I’d known how to react or what to do during the audition,” she said. “But, you know, I was so non-confrontational that I just didn’t.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Geena-Davis-Claims-Bill-Murray-Harassed-Her-Set-Quick-Change-002.jpg><p>Davis also noted that she <a href=#>didn’t want to focus on what could have been done differently</a>, saying, “There’s no point in regretting things, and yet, here I was regretting. And yes, exactly, it wasn’t my fault.”</p><p>The Golden Globe award winner’s claims come <a href=#>after the comedian was previously accused of inappropriate behavior</a>. Earlier this year, Searchlight Pictures <a href=#>suspended production on Murray’s film Being Mortal after an alleged incident</a> with another cast member.</p><p>“I did something I thought was funny, and it wasn’t taken that way,” the Ghostbusters star told CNBC in April, adding that <a href=#>there was a “difference of opinion” between him and a woman</a> he was working with. “The company, the movie studio, wanted to do the right thing, so they wanted to check it all out, investigate it, and so they stopped the production.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Murray added: “As of now, we are talking and we are trying to make peace with each other. We are both professionals, we like each others’ work, we like each other I think and if we can’t really get along and trust each other there’s no point in going further working together or making the movie as well. It’s been quite an education for me.”</p><p>Us Weekly has reached out to Murray’s rep for comment.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJ6enZ6WeqWt1aKqZpuclrauv4yboKWkXaLCs77AsmShmaKWwLSxw2afnqpdpLtuvdSimqRlk52ur7PEZqqerF8%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jay-z-and-beyonces-10th-anniversary-25-photos-through-the-years.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jay-Z And Beyonc's 10th Anniversary: 25 Photos Through The Years</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./alex-hogh-andersen-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-2-443747-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Alex Hogh Andersen Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./worlds-smallest-and-richest-countries-worth-visiting.html>10 Of The World's Smallest And Richest Countries</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breakfast-eatery-dessert-shop-headed-downtown-rock-hill.html>Breakfast eatery, dessert shop headed to downtown Rock Hill WSOC TV</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1430237-shannon-moore-is-6-years-sober-credits-wwe-for-saving-his-life.html>Shannon Moore Is 6 Years Sober, Credits WWE For Saving His Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./laconic-crossword-clue-99949425.html>Laconic Crossword Clue - News</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lionel-messi-world-cup-argentina-final.html>Lionel Messi doesnt need the ball to hurt you</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JotBlog.
