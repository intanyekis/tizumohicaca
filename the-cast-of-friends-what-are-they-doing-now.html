We didn’t know what to think when Friends was released in 1994. It wasn’t long before we fell in love with our favorite six friends, though, as we experienced all their life lessons and watched them grow up, get married, and start families. The show was an instant hit and Rachel, Ross, Monica, Chandler, Phoebe, and Joey became a staple in our lives. The show is one of the longest-running shows, and it ended not because it was canceled but because the actors themselves wanted to move on to new projects.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>What made the show so popular was the fact that everyone could relate to the problems of these 20-something characters. We saw their dating woes and realized that it was true that you really could have friends that stayed in your life forever.</p><p>Friends was on for an amazing ten seasons, and when it ended, people were broken-hearted about it. We loved the cast so much because of the intense chemistry and tight bond they had. When it came time to ask for a raise, they all banded together and made sure all six of them got $1 million an episode instead of going after raises alone — that’s true teamwork. So, what have these amazing characters been up to since the show? We know you're dying to find out. Here’s a peek into their lives now…</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jennifer-aniston-is-hitting-the-big-screen><strong>Jennifer Aniston Is Hitting The Big Screen&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>We love <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jennifer Aniston</a>. She's such a babe and she's managed to defy age the past 23 years. She, of course, played the flighty and sexy Rachel Green on the show, and we were so happy when she rekindled her relationship with Ross at the end of the series. These days, she's a Golden Globe winner and has been in numerous films like Horrible Bosses, Mother’s Day, Office Christmas Party, and He’s Just Not That Into You. Despite her divorce from <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Brad Pitt</a>, Jennifer&nbsp;found love again with her longtime beau <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Justin Theroux</a>, whom she married recently. She’s going to be on another TV series again with friend <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Reese Witherspoon</a> in the near future. It’s in production right now, and the title has yet to be released. All and all, this girl has been doing quite well for herself in Hollywood.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=cole-sprouse-is-making-trouble-at-riverdale><strong>Cole Sprouse Is Making Trouble At Riverdale&nbsp;</strong></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cole Sprouse</a> has turned into quite the hottie. He used to play little Ben, Ross’s son in Friends, and he was so cute. He no longer plays the sweet innocent boy anymore; this actor has a new brooding look to him. He went on to play on The Suite Life of Zack and Cody with his twin brother,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dylan Sprouse</a>. He then took four years off to study at a prestigious New York University. These days, he’s 25 years old, and he got a coveted role on the very popular TV series Riverdale playing Jughead Jones. He’s quite the brooding writer as well, judging by a post he made on Instagram: “Some people liken it to time stopping, but it's really just your eyes becoming louder than all your other senses. A sharp and directional focus, as if glasses were put on a face that never knew it was blind. All that white noise had finally ceased, and my mind was able to distill its attention into a single thing for the very first time. You became that first step outside a noisy bar. All this in a look. Just a break from the noise. Just a break. Look at yourself now that the noise is back. You've grown a lot haven't you kid, but you still hold onto those glasses, don't you?”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=courteney-cox-makes-history><strong>Courteney Cox Makes History&nbsp;</strong></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Courteney Cox</a> played Monica, the anal-retentive OCD friend on the show, and she ended up marrying her best friend. We cried through the years when the two of them fell in love, got married, and then had twins. The show has allowed us to cry with our favorite characters. After the show was over, she went on to star in Cougar Town.&nbsp;Jennifer even guest-starred on the show with her best friend. The show ran for a solid six years, and she's been on a few other shows here and there. She went on to make the 4th edition of the Scream movies as well. She hasn’t had the same success in Hollywood that Aniston's had, but she has nothing to complain about either.&nbsp;She's currently starring in Drunk History.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=matthew-perry-overcomes-addiction><strong>Matthew Perry Overcomes Addiction&nbsp;</strong></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Matthew</a>&nbsp;Perry definitely has a grizzlier appearance than he did on the show, but he’s still as handsome as ever. He played the awkward but funny friend on the show who ended up marrying his best friend, Monica. These days, Perry's doing well for himself. He's had a decent career in Hollywood acting alongside some big names, like <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bruce Willis</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Salma Hayek</a>. He’s also had success on a few&nbsp;TV shows including Go On, The Good Wife,&nbsp;and The Odd Couple. He's struggled with sobriety over the years, and it's certainly affected his life as well as his weight. His weight fluctuated for a few years even while on Friends. He now uses his experience to help others who are also affected by their drug and alcohol use.</p><h2 id=lisa-kudrow-is-a-cameo-queen><strong>Lisa Kudrow Is A Cameo Queen&nbsp;</strong></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lisa Kudrow</a> was a favorite on the show because of her quirky personality as well as her odd singing career. She had a sexy side to her that always had her pulling in leading men. She never apologized for who she was as Phoebe, and she was always there when her friends needed her. She was one of the funniest characters alongside Matthew Perry. She hasn’t done much in the movie world since her departure from the show, though we did see her in some good ones like Web Therapy,&nbsp;Easy A, The Girl on the Train,&nbsp;and The Comeback. She's always been more focused on her family life, and is married to&nbsp;advertising exec Michel Stern with whom she shares a son. She's&nbsp;also been known to hit the stage with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Taylor Swift</a> now and again.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=matt-leblanc-is-mr-satire><strong>Matt LeBlanc Is Mr. Satire&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Joey was the ladies’ man on the show but sadly, by the end of season ten, we never saw him end up with anyone. He kind of ended up being the lone wolf. There was a moment&nbsp;when we thought he would end up with Rachel, but throughout the series, he’s just gone from one relationship to the next. He’s the only character that didn’t end up with anyone by the time the series ended. After the series wrapped up, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Matt LeBlanc</a> had his spinoff series Joey, but that didn’t last more than two seasons. It just wasn’t the same without his other friends. He, too, won a Golden Globe in 2012 for the role he had in Episodes. He's no longer with his wife, Melissa McKnight. They divorced, but they do share a child together. We do love the new silver fox look he’s pulling off these days, though.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=david-schwimmer-takes-on-the-courtroom><strong>David Schwimmer Takes On&nbsp;The Courtroom&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Oh, we loved Ross’s love for dinosaurs as much as we did of his love for Rachel Green. Fans everywhere were thrilled when the two got together at the end of the series. We wouldn’t want to have it any other way. Those two lovebirds belong together.&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">David</a> hasn’t had as much luck in the industry compared to the rest of his castmates, but he's been working consistently since the show ended. He recently portrayed Robert Kardashian in American Crime Story, and it's amazing how much he actually looks like the lawyer. He's also been seen in Feed the Beast, though he hasn’t been in anything at all in 2017. We look forward to seeing more of him in the future.</p><h2 id=aniston-s-fame><strong>Aniston’s Fame</strong></h2><p>These two babes are going to be in a TV series together. How can we not be excited? Judging by both of these ladies' careers, this show should be an instant hit. It seems that since her divorce, Jen’s life has just improved, whereas Brad Pitt isn’t doing quite as well. The theme of the show Friends has always been a constant in Jennifer’s life. Friends are so important to her; that’s why she's always stuck close to Courteney Cox even after all these years. “Where would you be without friends? The people to pick you up when you need lifting? We come from homes far from perfect, so you end up almost parent and sibling to your friends -- your own chosen family. There's nothing like a really loyal, dependable, good friend. Nothing.” We couldn’t agree more.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=cox-s-surgery><strong>Cox’s Surgery</strong></h2><p>Courteney Cox has clearly dabbled with Botox and plastic surgery over the years. Don’t get us wrong, she’s still a knockout, but she never needed to change herself at all. Recently, rumor has it that she stopped getting Botox injected so that she could return to a more natural-looking face. Let’s hope the rumors are true. “You know, my mother's beautiful, my dad was a really handsome man, and there was a lot of talk about looks when I was growing up.” Maybe that’s where she got the idea that she needed to change herself. The environment in which we grow up can affect how we view things later on in life. We love her just the way she is; we always have.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=maggie-wheeler><strong>Maggie Wheeler</strong></h2><p>We all remember Janice and that voice of hers. She was Chandler’s longtime girlfriend until she went back to her husband. She was the girl&nbsp;who made us all cringe every time she opened her mouth. Ever since the show ended, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Maggie Wheeler</a> has worked in Hollywood consistently over the years. She appeared for a while on Everybody Loves Raymond, How I Met Your Mother, Friday Night Lights,&nbsp;and Californication,&nbsp;and most recently, she's been on Archer. She has so many fond memories of the TV show Friends, and we can all relate to that. “I met a woman who went through a very difficult personal crisis, and she was really bed-ridden for a long time, and Friends&nbsp;got her through.” Talk about amazing.</p><h2 id=kudrow-s-projects><strong>Kudrow’s Projects</strong></h2><p>We just loved Phoebe’s musical musings, especially “Smelly Cat,” and we&nbsp;weren’t the only ones&nbsp;who enjoyed the quirky song either. Taylor Swift adored the song so much so that during her&nbsp;1989 World Tour Live, she invited Lisa Kudrow to perform “Smelly Cat” live on stage with her in Los Angeles. Talk about an amazing tribute&nbsp;to all those Friends fans out there. The crowd went nuts, of course, and it’s just one of those moments you don’t want to miss. Kudrow has said that she wished that Friends had gone on longer than it did, and we couldn’t agree more.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=tom-selleck><strong>Tom Selleck</strong></h2><p>Talk about a living legend. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tom Selleck</a> has had a pretty long career in Hollywood, and he’s still going strong. In Friends, he played Monica’s successful and handsome boyfriend Richard. For a while there, we were sure that the two of them were going to end up together, but in the end, Chandler won her heart. Selleck's&nbsp;most notable roles over the years have been in&nbsp;Boston Legal, Las Vegas, and most recently,&nbsp;Blue Bloods. We can see why he favors roles like this; he’s always had that distinguished look about him. Selleck has a lot of experience on TV and with that comes a lot of wisdom. “I don't feel the obligation to have a big explosion in the first 20 seconds, so the audience doesn't turn on another channel. We are trying to make something that looks like a feature film that was bought for television, and I think we are succeeding.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=matthew-perry-s-challenges><strong>Matthew Perry’s Challenges</strong></h2><p>Matthew Perry has always said that he really just enjoys making people laugh, and he certainly did that on Friends despite the many challenges he had in life. As much as he enjoyed making the show Friends, he also hates when people are only interested in him because he was on the show. “I can tell if someone is talking to me because I'm on Friends&nbsp;or 'cause they just think I'm neat. You know, I don't think I've ever spent more than five or ten minutes with somebody who was ogling me because they recognized me from the show.” We've certainly loved watching him play Ted Kennedy in The Kennedys After Camelot,&nbsp;especially when he played alongside <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Katie Holmes</a> as Jackie O. The two have really great chemistry together, and it was a joy to see him in that kind of role.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=matt-leblanc-as-joey><strong>Matt LeBlanc as Joey</strong></h2><p>Yup, that’s <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Patrick Dempsey</a> there with Matt LeBlanc as they bond together over their love of cars. These guys look great together, don’t you think? These days, he’s been rocking it on Episodes, but he has a strong appreciation for all that he learned while being a part of Friends. “Friends was an education in intelligent comedic banter, in intelligent vernacular. It was an education in scene study. It was an education in group dynamic. I came out of there with a master's degree in comedy. When I was younger and studying acting, I never ever saw myself in the sitcom world; it was drama that really turned me on and still does.” He defiantly got his wish when he went into the drama world of Episodes. Regardless of what character he plays now, we'll always remember him fondly as Joey.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=david-schwimmer-is-always-up-for-a-challenge><strong>David Schwimmer Is Always Up For A Challenge</strong></h2><p>We can’t believe how much he looks like Robert Kardashian in this photo. He's come a long way since his role as Ross on Friends; he looks so much older, which is definitely not a bad thing. He’s always been a handsome guy. He was certainly a lucky guy when he was on the show and able to kiss Jennifer Aniston whenever he wanted to, even while she was with Brad Pitt. “It's a job -- someone's gotta kiss Jennifer Aniston. The reality is, Jennifer and I can do our job well because we truly are friends. But when the day's over, she goes home to her boyfriend, and I go home to a magazine.” When it comes to his job, though, he takes it seriously and looks for challenges. “I like to challenge myself. I like to learn -- so I like to try new things and try to keep growing."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmsKeiobFusc2tnKuskZ67rrHNrWatoJVisKK%2F02amn2WWp7amusOsZLCgkal6or7EZquhnalisbC1zaBkp6enZA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-chris-rocks-new-girlfriend-lake-bell.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who Is Chris Rock's New Girlfriend Lake Bell?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./stelle-ciccone.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Quick Facts About Stelle Ciccone, Madonna Adopted Daughter: Bio &amp;amp; Twins</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./worlds-smallest-and-richest-countries-worth-visiting.html>10 Of The World's Smallest And Richest Countries</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breakfast-eatery-dessert-shop-headed-downtown-rock-hill.html>Breakfast eatery, dessert shop headed to downtown Rock Hill WSOC TV</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1430237-shannon-moore-is-6-years-sober-credits-wwe-for-saving-his-life.html>Shannon Moore Is 6 Years Sober, Credits WWE For Saving His Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./laconic-crossword-clue-99949425.html>Laconic Crossword Clue - News</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lionel-messi-world-cup-argentina-final.html>Lionel Messi doesnt need the ball to hurt you</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JotBlog.
