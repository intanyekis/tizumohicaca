According to legal docs, obtained by <a href=#><i>TMZ</i></a>, Tekashi was paid an advance of $225,000 in October 2018.</p><p>The docs claim just 2 weeks after Tekashi got the wire, he was locked up ... making him unable to perform his duties for the company. What's more they say Tekashi's testimony during the trial totally torpedoed his ability to be a good brand ambassador for FN.</p><p>FN claims Tekashi was underhanded; he and his people concealed the entire criminal prosecution from them. In other words, what FN seems to be saying is that they had no idea Tekashi was a criminal.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single><b>RELATED: </b><a href=#><b>Tekashi 6ix9ine Admits To Flashing Fake Money In Social Media Posts</b></a></span></p><p>FN says Tekashi promised to return the $225k, but never did ... and now they're suing for $2.25 million.</p><p>As <a href=#><i>TMZ </i></a>reported -- Tekashi is set to be released in August of this year -- and he's got a lot of make-up to do in the outside world. Add FN to that list.</p><p>Earlier this week, Tekashi69 was forced to cough up some serious dough to Fashion Nova, according to a judgment in the company's 2020 suit and his bill could skyrocket if the other defendants don't pony up the cash.</p><p>Legal docs, obtained by <a href=#><i>TMZ</i></a>, show Tekashi agreed to a judgment against him in the amount of $350K, after Fashion Nova alleged he and others walked away with their cash in 2018.</p><p>Tekashi agreed he alone is responsible for paying off around $39K of the total.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, he could wind up paying way more because if the other defendants -- such as booking and entertainment companies -- don't cough up any of the remaining $311K, Tekashi will remain on the hook to satisfy the full judgment.</p><p>Tekashi puts it simply, telling <a href=#><i>TMZ</i></a> "That's hilarious," laughing at the amount of money he could owe. Unclear why he finds the situation funny seems like a big chunk of change.</p><p>As we reported, the clothing co. paid Tekashi an advance of $225K for brand promotion in 2018 -- he got locked up 2 weeks later ... making him unable to perform his duties.</p><p>FN claimed he promised to return the cash, but never did.</p><p><span class=next-single><b>READ NEXT: </b><a href=#><b>‘Confidential Assignment 2’ Film Reaches Over $35 Million On Second Weekend At Korean Box Office</b></a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>TMZ</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS%2ForzPnqlmrJWgrrS0yGZtorBpnrumecClo56flZm5unnSrpydZZKueqet0qGgqKZdo7y3rYyfpqtlY2p9cXyPaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./college-football.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Rome Odunze Bio: Age, Height, Weight, Family, Hometown, Career, College, and more</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./june-wilkinson-measurements-height-weight-and-age.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>June Wilkinson Measurements Height Weight and Age The Talks Today</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./worlds-smallest-and-richest-countries-worth-visiting.html>10 Of The World's Smallest And Richest Countries</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breakfast-eatery-dessert-shop-headed-downtown-rock-hill.html>Breakfast eatery, dessert shop headed to downtown Rock Hill WSOC TV</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1430237-shannon-moore-is-6-years-sober-credits-wwe-for-saving-his-life.html>Shannon Moore Is 6 Years Sober, Credits WWE For Saving His Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./laconic-crossword-clue-99949425.html>Laconic Crossword Clue - News</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lionel-messi-world-cup-argentina-final.html>Lionel Messi doesnt need the ball to hurt you</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JotBlog.
