Instead, he truly has a passion for makeup artistry, mainly because of his perennial obsession with visual shape-shifting.</p><h2>Eternal Love Affair with Makeup</h2><p>The rocker revealed his love affair with makeup, which stemmed from childhood when his mom used to put her wigs and lipstick on him when he was little.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Growing up in Canton, OH, Brian Hugh Warner began his creative ventures by decorating his face with watercolors to express his imaginations that could not be contained in a piece of music.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>He idolized rock gods like KISS and David Bowie. He&nbsp;rebelled against the Christian school that told him not to listen to their music. While KISS wore masks and relied on Kumadori to conceal their true self, he wanted to be seen, but not as Warner.&nbsp;</p><p>The rocker never intended to look androgynous and was just trying to hide a bad complexion as a teenager. Before perfecting his trademark makeup look, Manson went through a heavy experimental phase that involved pocketing Maybelline eyeliner from grocery stores.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>In the early performances I did, I wore Maybelline eyeliner that I would [take] from grocery stores late at night.

Notably, he’s a fan of Frank Booth, Dennis Hopper’s character in&nbsp;Blue Velvet, and Booth smearing lipstick on his face in the film inspired the rocker.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>And unlike most high-profile celebrities that have a glam team, Manson&nbsp;prefers to do his own makeup, which allows him to improvise as he applies it.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><h2>Mason’s Controversial Career</h2><p>The American heavy metal rock’n’roll icon has&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">sold</a>&nbsp;over 50 million albums, started as the controversial frontman of his band in the 1990s. He adopted the name Marilyn Mason, which is a blend of Marilyn Monroe and the serial killer Charles Manson, and&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">began</a>&nbsp;self-releasing cassettes and playing gigs in 1989.&nbsp;</p><p>The band’s stage show was renowned for Manson’s elaborate makeup and homemade special effects. In the summer of 1994, they released their debut LP, ‘Portrait of an American Family,’ launching the group to new heights of notoriety.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>But their popularity came at&nbsp;a cost.</p><p>The band was surrounded with furor for advocating a disconcerting vision of society that focused on sex, drugs, violence, politics, and organized religion. Civic groups and religious fronts regularly protested at their concerts.</p><p>However, that did not slow the rocker down as he released many albums that made the Billboard Top 200 charts.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGikrquZmLaiuo6mmKuhnK67brnAp6qopl2strW0zq6rZqWRoLK2vI2hq6ak</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./stan-wells-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Stan Wells Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./how-did-jill-stewart-die.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>How did Jill Stewart die ?
