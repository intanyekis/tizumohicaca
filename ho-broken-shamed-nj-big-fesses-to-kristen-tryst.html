Eliot Spitzer.</p><p><a class=legacy-link href=#><strong>PHOTO GALLERY: Ashley And Mr. & Mrs. Earle</strong></a></p><p><a class=legacy-link href=#><strong>MORE: Alisa & Ashley’s Tank Warfare</strong></a></p><p>“I’m very ashamed,” the contrite Casanova told The Post through his lawyer.</p><p>“TJ has accepted full responsibility – he’s not blaming anyone else,” Earle’s attorney, Mitchell Ansell, said. The hunky Earle, 35, has fessed up to a monthlong affair with 23-year-old Ashley “Kristen” Dupre.</p><p>As the Post exclusively revealed, it culminated in a clandestine Tuesday tryst at the Gramercy Park Hotel.</p><p>The romance started with a flirtation at a Jersey Shore eatery – during which the dad of two boasted, “I could have had her for free!”</p><p>A week later, Dupre was spotted “drooling” over Earle at a local bar.</p><p>This week, Earle whisked his paramour to Manhattan, where he’d booked them a room at the Gramercy.</p><p>“TJ made a grave mistake,” Ansell said.</p><p>Earle had told his wife, Alisa, 36, he was going on a business trip to Colorado. Instead, he and Dupre spent a day shopping, dining and drinking their way around the Big Apple.</p><p>Dupre walked the streets in a pair of super-short shorts, a shiny, low-cut tank and strappy heels. The duo then headed back to the hotel – the same one where Thomas and Alisa celebrate their wedding anniversary each year.</p><p>TJ returned to the Wall Township home he shares with Alisa and their two young daughters.</p><p>After a reporter tried to confront Alisa and TJ at their McMansion about his tryst, sources said the busted hubby told his stunned wife he was “set up” by a publicity-seeking Dupre.</p><p>Ansell said yesterday that’s not the case.</p><p>“TJ never said he was set up. He does not feel used by Ashley one bit,” Ansell said.</p><p>“He does not feel used by her at all.”</p><p>TJ briefly stopped by his home Thursday, but bolted when he saw media there. He later returned with dry cleaning in his car, but stayed only briefly and left the clothes in the car.</p><p>Later, he took his daughter out for ice cream, but dropped her off and did not spend the night at home.</p><p>Alisa – dressed astonishingly like Dupre yesterday – loaded the car with a Boogie Board and other beach toys and headed off with the kids.</p><p>But lawyer Ansell said TJ is determined to fix things with his family, noting, “He’s very, very sorry for what happened, and he’s trying to work through this privately.”</p><p>The headline-making dalliance has embarrassed the Earle family.</p><p>TJ Earle runs The Earle Companies, a major asphalt and road construction outfit, with two of his seven siblings. On its Web site, the firm touts its commitment to “values” and “integrity.”</p><p>In the aftermath of the Dupre scandal, Ansell said TJ is “taking actions like a man.”</p><p>“That’s how he has always been, that’s how he was raised, and that’s how his whole family is.”</p><p>The affair came as a shock to at least one of TJ’s college buddies, who knew him and Alisa when they all attended Lynn University in Boca Raton, Fla.</p><p>Alisa was dating a soccer player when TJ met her, and he did everything in his power to steal her away, the friend said in an e-mail to The Post.</p><p>She tamed the former “wild man,” said the pal, noting, “The second he laid eyes on Alisa, those [wild] days were over.”</p><p>“He was infatuated with Alisa the second they met, and I don’t think that has changed.”</p><p>The Earles have known Dupre since she was a teen. They live in the same close-knit area as the hooker’s mother, Carolyn Capalbo, and stepfather, and Dupre’s mom and Alisa work out together at a local gym.</p><p>Lawyers for Dupre could not be reached.</p><p><a class=a10blb href=#>perry.chiaramonte@nypost.com</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2JlfXl7j3Bma25fnbxurtGoop6mXai1ornEnWSnol2Xtqh5xZ6qrJ2jYsGwecqroKyslaN6tb7YrKto</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./leslie-mann-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Leslie Mann Net Worth | TheRichest</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./dj-quick-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>DJ Quik Net Worth | TheRichest</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./worlds-smallest-and-richest-countries-worth-visiting.html>10 Of The World's Smallest And Richest Countries</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breakfast-eatery-dessert-shop-headed-downtown-rock-hill.html>Breakfast eatery, dessert shop headed to downtown Rock Hill WSOC TV</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1430237-shannon-moore-is-6-years-sober-credits-wwe-for-saving-his-life.html>Shannon Moore Is 6 Years Sober, Credits WWE For Saving His Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./laconic-crossword-clue-99949425.html>Laconic Crossword Clue - News</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lionel-messi-world-cup-argentina-final.html>Lionel Messi doesnt need the ball to hurt you</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JotBlog.
