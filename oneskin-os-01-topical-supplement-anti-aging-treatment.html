OneSkin’s in-house team of scientists studied over 1,000 different molecules before they discovered OS-01 — a peptide that may actually help reduce your skin’s biological age and in turn smooth out wrinkles in the process. Is this the truly effective anti-aging treatment that we’ve been waiting for? It just might be!</p><p>OS-01 actually helps strengthen the skin by improving its epidermal thickness that’s lost as you get older. As this causes the signs of aging, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">it’s incredibly beneficial</a>! After a 12-week clinical study, 100% of users experienced an improvement in overall appearance and smoothness, with 90% seeing improved skin elasticity and 87% noticing diminished fine lines and wrinkles and last but not least. a15% average improvement in their skin barrier, which is related to the main function of the skin, This treatment may also help even out the skin tone, assist with firmness and decrease the size of your pores!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/OS-01-Topical-Supplement.jpg><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">OS-01 Topical Supplement</a> for <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$120</a>, available from OneSkin!</strong></p><p>There’s no need for over-the-top marketing and gimmicks with this product — the proof is in the pudding.
