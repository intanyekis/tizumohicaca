I don’t want to kill any of them,” Kelce quipped during the game. “Ariana, sorry, love you, but you’re gone. And then Taylor Swift would be the kiss. And what’s the last one? Katy Perry? Yeah, Katy Perry would be the marry.”</p><p class=p1>Of course, as the world knows now, Kelce got his wish. He started dating Swift in summer 2023 and have kissed many times over. Cameras were even rolling during their make-outs at the NFL’s AFC Championship and Super Bowl LVIII, as well as Coachella <a href=#>earlier this month</a>.</p><p class=p1>Swift dropped her 11th studio record, <i>The Tortured Poets Department</i>, on Friday, April 19. The LP, actually a double album, features a song called “So High School” that <a href=#>seems to directly reference</a> Kelce’s “Kiss, Marry, Kill” choices.</p><p class=p1>“Are you gonna marry, kiss, or kill me (Kill me),” Swift sings on the track. “It’s just a game, but really (Really) / I’m bettin’ on all three for us two (All three).”</p><p class=p1>She continues, “Get my car door, isn’t that sweet? (That sweet) / Then pull me to the backsеat (Backseat) / No one’s evеr had me (Had me), not like you.”</p><p class=p1>The second part of the verse could also refer to Kelce and <a href=#>their first public date night</a>. The pair made their couple debut during a dinner date in New York City in October 2023, where Kelce and Swift held hands. With his free hand, the Kansas City Chiefs tight end was seen opening the car door for Swift before they drove away.</p><p class=p1>In another “So High School” lyric, Swift appeared to mention Kelce’s pro football career.</p><p class=p1>“You know how to ball / I know Aristotle,” she sings. “Brand new, full throttle / Teach me while your bros play Grand Theft Auto / It’s true, swear, scouts honor. You knew what you wanted and, boy, you got her.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>The lyrics seemed to call back to the pair’s respective 2023 interviews about their connection. In a November 2023 interview with .<i>WSJ Magazine</i>, Kelce noted that<a href=#> it was “mind-blowing”</a> being with someone “smart” — who can presumably quote philosophers like Aristotle — like Swift. One month later, the Grammy winner spoke to <i>TIME Magazine </i>and gushed about Kelce, even noting that she had been <a href=#>“missing out”</a> by not watching or knowing about (to quote “So High School”) the sport.</p><p class=p1>While Swift famously has never explained her musical muses, her romance with Kelce keeps getting sweeter.</p><p class=p1>“[It’s] been so refreshing for Taylor not to feel the need to hide with Travis,” a source exclusively said in<a href=#> the latest issue of <i>Us Weekly</i></a>. “He makes her feel safe and protected like she has the freedom to be and act however she wants.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGawmaSYtW7A0ZqtoqtdoLKtr8SsZKSho6h6rq3Rq7Bmo5mhuW6txa2cq2WjpHqptcahZKybmKS8rXnLsqmim18%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./what-its-like-to-date-brooklyn-beckham-according-to-his-exgirlfriends.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>What It's Like To Date Brooklyn Beckham, According To His Ex-Girlfriends</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./to-not-die-chapter-109-release-date-and-where-to-read.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>To Not Die Chapter 109 Release Date and Where To Read</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./worlds-smallest-and-richest-countries-worth-visiting.html>10 Of The World's Smallest And Richest Countries</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breakfast-eatery-dessert-shop-headed-downtown-rock-hill.html>Breakfast eatery, dessert shop headed to downtown Rock Hill WSOC TV</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1430237-shannon-moore-is-6-years-sober-credits-wwe-for-saving-his-life.html>Shannon Moore Is 6 Years Sober, Credits WWE For Saving His Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./laconic-crossword-clue-99949425.html>Laconic Crossword Clue - News</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lionel-messi-world-cup-argentina-final.html>Lionel Messi doesnt need the ball to hurt you</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JotBlog.
