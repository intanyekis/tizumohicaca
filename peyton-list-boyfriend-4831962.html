The former couple began their romance in 2017 and decided to call it quits by January 2019. But before the flame fizzled out, Peyton and her first public boyfriend met on the set of the 2017 movie Anthem of a Teenage Prophet.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>The blonde bombshell confirmed their relationship to the <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Build Series</a> during an interview in Sept. 2018. “The whole cast, we all shared a trailer and were all in the same hotel. It was a small town, two and a half hours away from Vancouver, so we all really got to know each other and all became so close,” Peyton said at the time. “And then sort of in the middle of it, Cameron and I started realizing we liked each other and started dating after.” And it was during that interview that Peyton credited her then-boyfriend for being “so understanding” of her busy work schedule.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>But just a little over a year after that interview, the duo’s hot romance ran its course, as they officially split in January 2019. And although neither of them commented publicly on their breakup, they chose to keep things civil. That January, both of the actors showed up to the premiere of the movie together, post-split, according to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>E! News</a>.</p><h2>Jacob Bertrand</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Peyton-List-romantic-history-ss-post1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-6>Things were quiet for a while when it came to matters of the heart for Peyton, until March 2022. That spring, <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>TMZ confirmed</a> that <strong>Jacob Bertrand</strong>, 22, and his costar, Peyton, were <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>officially a couple</a>! The Cobra Kai actors were spotted at LAX together when a TMZ reporter asked Peyton if they were a couple, to which she replied, “Yeah.” And when the reporter asked Jacob about dating someone he worked with, he admitted that it was a first for him. “This is trial by fire almost,” the actor said.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>During the same interview, Jacob, who plays Eli Moskowitz on the show, admitted that he actually was friends with his girlfriend long before their love blossomed. “We’ve been friends for a while now, I met her when I was 15,” he told the outlet. He also shared that he was friends with Peyton’s brother, <strong>Spencer List</strong>, first, and that it was “awkward” to tell him that he “liked” his sister.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>And just as the pair confirmed they were involved with each other, Peyton shared a loving <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram post</a> to commemorate her man’s birthday. Her March 6, 2022, post read, “happy birthday jacob man you change your hair a lot. there are not a lot of photos where you are serious without me yelling at you so i had to post those first.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>Their romance rumors sparked when Jacob first shared his own <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>birthday post</a> for Peyton back on April 6, 2021. In one of the images in the post, Peyton and Jacob posed for a cute photo together. In the second slide, however, Jacob is seen hilariously eating some cake. His adorable post was captioned, “Happy Birthday lists! I didnt have a nice picture with spencer so heres him moments before devouring peytons banana foster thing. The other is just peyton lookin cute and i happen to be in the background.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8%2BesK2nnmK5qr%2FTZpmosZantqa6w2ZrcWthboNzew%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./justine-skye-reveals-her-favorite-scents-memories-in-nyc.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Justine Skye Reveals Her Favorite Scents, Memories in NYC</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./blake-proehl-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-707000-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Blake Proehl Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./worlds-smallest-and-richest-countries-worth-visiting.html>10 Of The World's Smallest And Richest Countries</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breakfast-eatery-dessert-shop-headed-downtown-rock-hill.html>Breakfast eatery, dessert shop headed to downtown Rock Hill WSOC TV</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1430237-shannon-moore-is-6-years-sober-credits-wwe-for-saving-his-life.html>Shannon Moore Is 6 Years Sober, Credits WWE For Saving His Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./laconic-crossword-clue-99949425.html>Laconic Crossword Clue - News</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lionel-messi-world-cup-argentina-final.html>Lionel Messi doesnt need the ball to hurt you</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JotBlog.
