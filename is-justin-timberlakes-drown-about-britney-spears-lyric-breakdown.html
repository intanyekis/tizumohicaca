The pair dated from 1999 to 2002 before calling it quits amid rumors Spears cheated on Timberlake with choreographer<strong> Wade Robson</strong>.</p><p>Timberlake also questions if the romance could have worked out if things were different. “Sometimes I sit and fantasize / Maybe sometime in another life / We could’ve got it right, got it right,” the bridge decrees.</p><p>While Timberlake never officially confirmed who the song was about, the release comes nearly four months after Spears dropped her tell-all memoir,&nbsp;<i>The Woman in Me</i>. In the book, Spears revealed details about her and Timberlake’s romance, including claims that she had an abortion and that Timberlake had cheated on her multiple times and broke up with her over text. (Following the book’s release, a source told&nbsp;<i>Us Weekly</i>&nbsp;that Timberlake had<a id=OWA69847fce-0a25-2977-7bd6-a9a8f14ed8d4 class=x_OWAAutoLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-auth=NotApplicable data-linkindex=3>&nbsp;</a><a id=OWA69847fce-0a25-2977-7bd6-a9a8f14ed8d4 class=x_OWAAutoLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-auth=NotApplicable data-loopstyle=linkonly data-linkindex=4>no clue he would be featured so much</a>&nbsp;in the book.</p><p>“Justin thought Britney might talk about their ups and downs in more general terms – not air out their very personal, dirty laundry,” the insider explained in October 2023. “He’s disappointed she went this route decades after they split up.”</p><p>Another source claimed that Timberlake – who shares sons Silas and Phineas with wife <strong>Jessica Biel</strong> – feels remorseful but hopes they can move past this.</p><p>“Justin regrets that he hurt Britney. He was young,” the second source shared with&nbsp;<i>Us.</i>&nbsp;“He thinks Britney has every right to tell her story and hopes they can move on now.”</p><p>While Timberlake faced backlash after Spears’ memoir, she seemed to issue him<a id=OWAd8f50bf8-88a9-9132-eca5-d63a98ebcf98 class=x_OWAAutoLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-auth=NotApplicable data-linkindex=5>&nbsp;</a><u><a id=OWAd8f50bf8-88a9-9132-eca5-d63a98ebcf98 class=x_OWAAutoLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-auth=NotApplicable data-loopstyle=linkonly data-linkindex=6>an </a></u><a id=OWAd8f50bf8-88a9-9132-eca5-d63a98ebcf98 class=x_OWAAutoLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-auth=NotApplicable data-loopstyle=linkonly data-linkindex=6>apology</a>&nbsp;last month.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Inside-Britney-Spears-and-Justin-Timberlake-s-Reignited-Feud-inline.jpg><p>“I wanna apologize for some of the things I wrote about in my book,” Spears captioned an Instagram post at the time, which included a clip of Timberlake performing during a “Classroom Instruments” segment on<i>&nbsp;The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon</i>. “If I offended any of the people I genuinely care about I am deeply sorry. Also wanted to say I am in love with Justin Timberlake’s new song ‘Selfish.’ It is so good and how come every time I see Justin and Jimmy together I laugh so hard ???”</p><p>Shortly after Spears’ appeared to say sorry, Timberlake performed a concert in New York. While introducing his 2002 song “Cry Me a River,” which seemingly alludes to his breakup with Spears, Timberlake spoke to the audience.</p><p>“I’d like to take this opportunity to apologize to <a id=OWA836a5ee5-0084-7afe-8d7f-fc8e41b1c885 class=x_OWAAutoLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-auth=NotApplicable data-loopstyle=linkonly data-linkindex=7>absolutely f–king nobody</a>,” he said, per footage shared via social media.</p><p>Spears quickly<a id=OWAc65bd9ef-ff51-1291-f7a4-01fae35dbf5a class=x_OWAAutoLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-auth=NotApplicable data-linkindex=8>&nbsp;</a><a id=OWAc65bd9ef-ff51-1291-f7a4-01fae35dbf5a class=x_OWAAutoLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-auth=NotApplicable data-loopstyle=linkonly data-linkindex=9>retracted her apology</a> afterward.</p><p>“Someone told me someone was talking s–t about me on the streets !!!” the singer wrote via Instagram on February 1. “Do you want me to bring it to the court or will you go home crying to your mom like you did last time ??? I’m not sorry !!!”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Drown” wouldn’t be the first time Timberlake allegedly sang about his split from Spears. “Cry Me a River,” off his 2002 album Justified, seemingly accused the pop star of infidelity, with Timberlake casting a Spears lookalike as the female lead in the music video. “What Goes Around … Comes Around,” off his second solo record, FutureSex/Love Sounds, also appeared to reference their relationship.</p><p>Spears opened up about being the subject of Timberlake’s early ‘00s music in The Woman in Me, saying Timberlake <a href=#>got “power”</a> from “shaming” her for the breakup. Spears wrote that although her managers tried to portray her as “an eternal virgin” — despite losing her virginity at the age of 14 — she was subsequently labeled as a “cheating slut” and a liar after Timberlake publicly confirmed their relationship was sexual.</p><p>Timberlake, for his part, shared in his own 2018 memoir, Hindsight: & All the Things I Can’t See in Front of Me, that he wrote “Cry Me a River” after <a href=#>feeling “scorned”</a> and “pissed off” about the split. “The feelings I had were so strong that I had to write it, and I translated my feelings into a form where people could listen and, hopefully, relate to it,” he wrote. “People heard me and they understood it because we’ve all been there.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKCsZZqqwLW1zWaroqWSmr%2BtrcqeqmacoqTEr3nAm6aurF2Xv6rAzZ6wZqugmq6zv4ylsKuhk2Kvs7HApJuor55k</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./katie-richards-obituary.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Katie Richards Obituary, Former UND, Mayville State University, Family</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./nathalie-kelley.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Dynasty Actress, Nathalie Kelley Has Separated From Two Years Of Husband, Jordy Burrows in 2020</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./worlds-smallest-and-richest-countries-worth-visiting.html>10 Of The World's Smallest And Richest Countries</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breakfast-eatery-dessert-shop-headed-downtown-rock-hill.html>Breakfast eatery, dessert shop headed to downtown Rock Hill WSOC TV</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1430237-shannon-moore-is-6-years-sober-credits-wwe-for-saving-his-life.html>Shannon Moore Is 6 Years Sober, Credits WWE For Saving His Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./laconic-crossword-clue-99949425.html>Laconic Crossword Clue - News</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lionel-messi-world-cup-argentina-final.html>Lionel Messi doesnt need the ball to hurt you</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JotBlog.
