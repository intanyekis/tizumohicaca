Getting pettier every year,” another person<a href=#> penned</a>.</p><p>Still, others felt that the sentiment was positive — or that it held a different meaning.</p><p>“Can’t believe people are interpreting this negatively. justin is saying he’s grateful for the life he has as is,” <a href=#>said</a> one fan. “Or he could be talking about something else or his mental health. be fr. its been 10 years. let it go,” <a href=#>commented</a> another user.</p><p>The Grammy winner has been married to Hailey since 2018, but continues to be involved with drama surrounding the <a href=#>Only Murders in the Building</a> star, 30, even five years after splitting for good following years of on-and-off relationship woes.</p><p>Gomez and Hailey, 26, raised eyebrows late last month when they appeared to be feuding via social media.</p><p>After the model and pal <a href=#><strong>Kylie Jenner</strong> </a>were accused by fans of<a href=#> making fun of the Golden Globe nominee’s eyebrows</a> via social media, the Kardashians star, 25, denied the rumors via TikTok on February 23. “No shade towards selena ever,” Jenner clarified at the time, which <a href=#>Gomez acknowledged</a>. “Agreed @kyliejenner It’s all unnecessary,” she replied to the Kylie Cosmetics mogul’s comment. “I’m a fan of Kylie!”</p><p>Hours later, however, the “Wolves” songstress didn’t hold back when commenting on a resurfaced video of Hailey gagging at the mention of <a href=#><strong>Taylor Swift</strong></a>.</p><p>“So sorry, my best friend is and continues to be one of the best in the game,” the Disney Channel alum wrote in response.</p><p>In addition to seemingly tossing his own hat in the ring amid the controversy, Justin also made a surprise appearance at the Rolling Loud music festival in Los Angeles on Saturday, March 5 — days after <a href=#>he seemingly canceled his remaining Justice World tour dates</a>.</p><p>The “Sorry” artist joined “Private Landing” collaborator<strong> Don Toliver</strong> on stage to perform their new track for the cheering crowd. Less than a week prior, eagle-eyed fans noticed that Ticketmaster marked all of Justin’s upcoming concerts in the U.S., Ireland, France, Poland, Australia, Denmark and the Czech Republic as canceled.</p><p>Though Justin and his team have yet to comment on the seemingly canceled dates, the “Ghost” singer announced in June 2022 that he would be postponing the tour amid <a href=#>his diagnosis with Ramsay Hunt syndrome</a>, which can cause temporary facial paralysis.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“This is pretty serious as you can see. I wish this wasn’t the case. But obviously, my body is telling me I need to slow down,” Justin shared in the Instagram video at the time, showing off <a href=#>the lack of movement in half of his face</a>.</p><p>“[He] has every faith this will resolve itself eventually, but of course, it’s a stressful situation to be dealing with and a tough time for both [him and Hailey] right now,” a source exclusively told <a href=#>Us Weekly </a>at the time of Justin’s diagnosis. “The last thing he wanted was to postpone the concerts.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGajraOptq95waKcm52iYsCmscyipaCkqWLAqa3Dnqpmq5Whsq%2BtjKCmpp2qYq61eceiqmaamafBqbDAsmSpmaKpxnA%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./lauren-griffith-died.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Lauren Griffith Died : A Sudden Loss for Southwestern PA Eye Center</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./julian-edelman-net-worth-earnings-contract-career-wife-daughter-height-more.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Julian Edelman Net Worth, Earnings, Contract, Career, Wife, Daughter, Height &amp;amp; More</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./worlds-smallest-and-richest-countries-worth-visiting.html>10 Of The World's Smallest And Richest Countries</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breakfast-eatery-dessert-shop-headed-downtown-rock-hill.html>Breakfast eatery, dessert shop headed to downtown Rock Hill WSOC TV</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1430237-shannon-moore-is-6-years-sober-credits-wwe-for-saving-his-life.html>Shannon Moore Is 6 Years Sober, Credits WWE For Saving His Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./laconic-crossword-clue-99949425.html>Laconic Crossword Clue - News</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lionel-messi-world-cup-argentina-final.html>Lionel Messi doesnt need the ball to hurt you</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JotBlog.
