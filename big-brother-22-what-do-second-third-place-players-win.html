With yet another 'All-Star' season having come and gone, tonight's drama-filled episode had us all on the edge of our seats, and rightfully so! With the three-part head of household competition continuing at the start of tonight's episode, it was Cody Calafiore that beat out <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Enzo Palumbo</a> and headed straight to the final part of the competition alongside Nicole Franzel.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The memory game left Cody winning the final HOH and taking none other than Enzo to the final 2 with him. While <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Nicole may have been blindsided</a>, she's taken home the grand prize before! After campaigning to the jury, it was Cody Calafiore who took home the grand prize of $500,000 and the title of 'Big Brother All-Stars' winner. While fans couldn't be happier for Cody, many are wondering whether 2nd and 3rd place players win any prize?

With Enzo, Nicole, and Cody taking the top 3 this season, fans didn't know who would walk away with the $500,000 grand prize, and alas we have finally crowned a winner. After winning the second part of the final head of household competition, Cody faced off with Nicole to find out who would be heading to the final 2.</p><p>While Nicole has previously won a season, fans hoped that she would make history as the only player to win the game twice.&nbsp;Although that would have been a groundbreaking 'Big Brother' moment, it was none other than <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cody Calafiore who won it all!</a> The 'BB' star won with a unanimous 9 - 0 vote against Enzo Palumbo and is taking home the $500,000 grand prize.</p><p>With yet another 'BB' winner and a pretty paycheck, fans have wondered what 2nd and 3rd place players take home. Well, as for second place, who in this case, is Enzo, wins an impressive $50,000! That's quite a hefty amount, and perhaps Enzo can finally by himself that big TV he's been talking about all season long.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What Does Julie Chen Really Think About Nicole Franzel?</a></span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Big-Brother-Dan-Gheesling.jpg><p>While second place receives a nice prize, the same cannot be said for third place! Nicole, who came in third this season, is walking away with nothing! 'Big Brother' has never rewarded the third-place player with any prize, leaving the final paycheck to be paid out to 'America's Favorite Player'. Da'Vonne took home the $25,000 this season, whereas massive 'Big Brother' names such as Jeff Schroeder, Dan Gheesling, and Janelle Pierzina have <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">all won the $25,000 prize in past seasons.&nbsp;</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It is clear that this season was one worth following, and after winning competition after competition, Cody Calafiore earned what was rightfully his, and fans couldn't be happier for him. It's been one heck of a ride.
