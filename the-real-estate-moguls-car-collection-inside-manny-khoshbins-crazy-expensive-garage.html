A true car enthusiast, let’s look at some of the most expensive cars in his collection.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=bugatti-chiron-herm-s-edition-6-million>Bugatti Chiron Hermès Edition ($6 million)</h2><p>One of the most exclusive cars in America, Manny Khoshbin, collaborated with the French fashion house Hermès to create a one-of-a-kind Bugatti Chiron Veyron.

Based on the latest generation of 911, he believes that it is the best car money can buy.</p><h2 id=pagani-huayra-herm-s-edition-5-million>Pagani Huayra Hermès Edition ($5 million)</h2><p>In another collaboration with Hermès, Khoshbin contacted Pagani to create a car designed by his favorite designer, and the automaker complied. The dark brown vehicle was given a refreshing interior and stocked with a V-12 twin-turbo engine sourced by AMG, as noted by <a href=#>Motor 1</a>. Each interior item was custom-made in Paris by Hermès.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=rolls-royce-phantom-drophead-445-000>Rolls Royce Phantom Drophead ($445,000)</h2><p>The Phantom is a unique white-on-white car from Rolls Royce in the collection. In the family car, Khoshbin is often photographed in the car with his wife and children. The Phantom Drophead has only clocked 5,400 miles.

The mogul has previously owned a Ferrari 360 Spider and F40.</p><h2 id=custom-carbon-black-mclaren-p1-1-1-million>Custom Carbon Black McLaren P1 ($1.1 million)</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While all McLaren P1s are made from carbon fiber, it is only limited to the body panels. In 2014, McLaren released 20 limited edition hypercars with carbon fiber everywhere. As mentioned by <a href=#>Yahoo</a>, when Khoshbin first purchased the car in 2012, McLaren declined to offer customization. However, once the full-body carbon package was announced, he became one of the 20 lucky people to get the car.</p><p>Other notable cars in Manny Khoshbin’s garage include the Tesla Model X, Porsche 935, Rolls Royce Ghost, McLaren Speedtail, McLaren Senna, and many more.
