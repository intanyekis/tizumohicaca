Shots have been fired left, right, and center and we’re just getting started!</p><p>Jill’s decision to hand the reins to her son Billy seemed out of left field, but when you consider that she had one foot out the door and into retirement when she hired Lily as CEO, maybe it shouldn’t have been so unexpected. In most cases, an heir succeeding their parent isn’t all that unsettling — we’re sure Devon won’t expect pushback when he hands his power over to Dom in the future — but in this case, well, it’s warranted due to Billy’s track record. He’s a wild card, and though he claims to have changed, it’s only been a minute since he jumped ship from his last position.<br><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Billy-YR-HW.jpg alt="Billy Y&R" width=1024 height=598 sizes="(min-width: 100rem) 1000px, (min-width: 91rem) 681px, (min-width: 48rem) 450px, (max-width: 48rem) 250px" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Jill might have given Devon and Lily a heads-up were it not for the in-fighting already going, but regardless, the blindside sent Devon into damage control mode, and as a result a couple of shocking things happened.</p><p>First, Devon went to Tucker looking for help in dealing with his Jill/Billy problem. A stunning turn of events given that he’s virtually disowned his father for being shady… and approached him for assistance in doing something shady. Devon was hoping Tucker would give him blackmail deets on Jill, and as it turned out, he didn’t have anything on her. He’s just that good at bluffing. The conversation took a turn when Tucker offered to use his well-honed underhanded techniques to deal with Billy, and Devon opted out. It sounded too messy and he feared Tucker would only make more problems for him.<br><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Devon-Tucker-YR-CBS.jpg alt width=1024 height=598 sizes="(min-width: 100rem) 1000px, (min-width: 91rem) 681px, (min-width: 48rem) 450px, (max-width: 48rem) 250px" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>While Devon thought that was the end of it, Tucker left the talk convinced that he needed to make a move on Billy immediately to ingratiate himself with his son. Phyllis then gave him a nice bit of intel to work with as Tucker now knows that Jill handed the reins to Billy, who is out of Genoa City and touring the regional offices.</p><p>If that’s not enough to convince you that more drama is ahead, consider what happened at Chancellor-Winters offices after Devon’s chat with Tucker. Devon called an emergency board meeting sans Billy to try and neutralize him. This went over with Jill about as well as one would expect, but it was Abby who threw the preceedings into chaos when she voted against her baby daddy and sided with her uncle and his mother.<br><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Jill-YR-CBS.jpg alt width=1024 height=598 sizes="(min-width: 100rem) 1000px, (min-width: 91rem) 681px, (min-width: 48rem) 450px, (max-width: 48rem) 250px" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>The set up for this was Abby’s conversation with Daniel, who suggested that Devon’s reason for putting her on the board was to shore up his own power, assuming his lover would follow his lead during votes. This really rankled Ms. Newman Abbott Chancellor, and Devon failing to mention the emergency meeting to her ahead of time only added insult to injury. Blindsided by the sneaky move to harness Billy’s power, Abby voted accordingly, and Devon’s reaction only seemed to drive home Daniel’s point about her lover’s expectations.<br><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Abby-Daniel-YR-CBS.jpg alt width=1024 height=598 sizes="(min-width: 100rem) 1000px, (min-width: 91rem) 681px, (min-width: 48rem) 450px, (max-width: 48rem) 250px" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><br></p><p>Abby explained her reasoning behind her vote and shamed Devon for putting her into an unfair position. Though he fell all over himself apologizing, we couldn’t help but wonder if we were seeing the first crack in their relationship. And there are more challenges ahead — just wait until Abby finds out he went to Tucker of all people for help!<br><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Abby-Devon-YR-CBS.jpg alt width=1024 height=598 sizes="(min-width: 100rem) 1000px, (min-width: 91rem) 681px, (min-width: 48rem) 450px, (max-width: 48rem) 250px" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>If Tucker proves to be an agent of chaos for Chancellor-Winters, and does something underhanded to Billy, Abby’s going to blame Devon for unleashing the Kraken.</p><p>Yes, folks, there’s more drama ahead, not only for Abby and Devon, but for Chancellor-Winters as a whole.
