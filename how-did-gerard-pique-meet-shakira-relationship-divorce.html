It is unlikely that Shakira or Piqué will act like best friends anytime soon, but it was not always like this.

In January 2012, they attended their first public event for Zurich's FIFA Ballon D’Or Awards. They never did get married, but this was not something Shakira felt they needed.</p><p>When asked in an interview with Glamour in 2014 if they would ever marry, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Shakira quickly confirmed they were very committed to each other</a>. "We already have what's essential, you know? We have a union, a love for each other, and a baby," she told the publication.

She trusted that Gerard Piqué's love and commitment for her was enough, and she believed he was an "amazing man."

She also commented on how the attention their split received has made everything even more challenging, that and the fact that they share young children who she has wanted to protect from hurt as much as possible.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Who Did Shakira Date Before Pique?</a></span></p><p>"I've tried to conceal the situation in front of my kids," she said. "I try to do it and to protect them, because that's my number one mission in life. But then they hear things in school from their friends, or they come across some disagreeable, unpleasant news online, and it just affects them, you know?"</p><p>She also commented on how the media had twisted the narrative. "And what's also real is the disappointment to see something as sacred, and as special as I thought was the relationship I had with my kids' father and see that turned into something vulgarized and cheapened by the media," she explained.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/shakira-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A month after this interview, she dropped a new song, "Monotonía," which appeared to have been, in part, a comment on her breakup. The former couple was able to come to a custody agreement, and then in January 2023, another new song "BZRP Music Session #53," was released in collaboration with Bizarrap. The lyrics hinted at someone being hurt by their partner's betrayal.</p><p><a href=#>Gerard Piqué is believed to be with someone new already</a>.
