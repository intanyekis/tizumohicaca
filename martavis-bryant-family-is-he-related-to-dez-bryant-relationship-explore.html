Well, today we’re going to put an end to all of your curiosity by answering your questions. Stay with us for all of the details! Martavis Bryant is an American football wide receiver who plays for the Dallas Cowboys in the NFL.</p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/superstarsculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Untitled-design-1.jpg alt="Easy way to win money online (1)" width=550 height=100 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>His NFL career began when the Pittsburgh Steelers selected him in the fourth round of the 2014 draft. Popular for his speed and abilities, he quickly established himself as the team’s WR2 alongside Antonio Brown. Despite three great seasons with the Steelers, Bryant received a full-season suspension in 2016 for violating the league’s drug policy.</p><p>This marked a watershed moment, as the once-prominent receiver was eventually traded to the Oakland Raiders in 2018. Bryant shown his brilliance during his season with the Raiders despite struggling with injuries. Unfortunately, his return was brief, as he was suspended indefinitely for violating his reinstatement requirements.</p><p>Since then, Bryant has remained on the sidelines, hoping for an opportunity to return to the NBA. His career has been a rollercoaster ride, emphasising both the highs of success and the challenges that come with being an NFL player.</p><h2><span id=Is_Martavis_Bryant_Related_to_Dez_Bryant>Is Martavis Bryant Related to Dez Bryant?</span></h2><p class=toc_title>Page Contents</p><ul class=toc_list><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">1</span> Is Martavis Bryant Related to Dez Bryant?</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">2</span> Father of Three Children</a></li></ul><p>In the vast world of football, where genetics frequently decide legacies, Martavis Bryant and Dez Bryant show how destiny can play a melody. They were not born into the same family, but their kinship is stronger than familial ties, thanks to a shared surname and a profound passion for the game.</p><p>Martavis, who currently wears the Dallas Cowboys’ famed star, follows in Dez’s footsteps, leaving an indelible mark on the team from 2010 to 2017. Both veteran wide receivers are dancing on the same pitch, weaving intricate patterns in search of glory. It’s a narrative with echoes of the past, as Dez, a first-round pick in the 2010 NFL Draft, developed an impressive career that included three Pro Bowl trips and an All-Pro championship in 2014.</p><p>The Bryants may not share a genealogy, but their story is a bright brushstroke painting on the canvas of the Dallas Cowboys’ legacy—clear proof of passion for the game, comparable goals, and fate’s twisting turns. Martavis Alexander Bryant was born December 20, 1991, in Calhoun Falls, South Carolina.</p><p>Martavis was reared by his single mother, Roberta Bryant, who plays an important role in his life. His father, who remains unknown to the world, has never been present for his son. Bryant, who never had a biological sibling, has a cousin, Kelly Bryant, whom he admires and loves as much as his brother. Kelly, like Martavis, participates in athletics and adores football. He now plays quarterback for the Arlington Renegades of the XFL.</p><h2><span id=Father_of_Three_Children>Father of Three Children</span></h2><p>Martavis Bryant, who has always been denied fatherly tenderness, is now a father to three children. His offspring, however, were all born to separate women. Brooker, his first daughter with ex-girlfriend Janessa, was born in 2010. In 2012, he and his other former partner, Jasmin Keesley, welcomed their second child, London.</p><p>Dez Bryant and Deja Hiott have a baby named Kalle King Alexander Bryant, born on March 23, 2017. His current girlfriend, from Albany, South Carolina, is a model with 219k Instagram followers. Furthermore, Deja Nicole Hiott Johnson (born August 28, 1996) is an entrepreneur. She owns and operates Hiott Jewellery. In addition, we discovered that the athlete’s girlfriend had previously been prosecuted by Dorchester County for marijuana possession.</p><p><span data-sheets-root=1 data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Is Deadliest Catch&#39;s Josh Harris Wed?
