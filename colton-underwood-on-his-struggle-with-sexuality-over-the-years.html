Underwood subsequently appeared on Bachelor in Paradise during the summer of 2018, briefly rekindling his fling with <a href=#>Kufrin’s pal <strong>Tia Booth</strong></a>, whom he met before he appeared on the publicist’s season.</p><p>During the fall of 2018, ABC named Underwood the season 23 Bachelor. His season debuted in January 2019 and had a rocky finish, with front-runner <a href=#><strong>Cassie Randolph</strong> quitting the competition ahead of the finale</a>. The athlete ultimately broke up with his other finalists and convinced Randolph to stay and give their romance a shot. After <a href=#>more than one year together, the twosome confirmed in May 2020</a> that they went their separate ways.</p><p>After <a href=#>battling coronavirus and facing allegations of stalking and harassment</a> from Randolph (which he denied), Underwood <a href=#>came out as gay in April 2021.</a></p><p>“I’ve ran from myself for a long time. I’ve hated myself for a long time. … I’m gay,” he told <a href=#><strong>Robin Roberts</strong></a> on Good Morning America. “And I came to terms with that earlier this year and have been processing it. And the next step in all of this was sort of letting people know.”</p><p>Following the interview, the <a href=#>30 women who appeared on Underwood’s season began to speak out.</a></p><p>“Do I regret being the Bachelor?<a href=#> Do I regret handling it the way that I did?</a> I do think I could have handled it better, I’ll say that,” he told Roberts at the time. “I just wish I wouldn’t have dragged people into my own mess of figuring out who I was. I genuinely mean that, but I also, at the same time, I can sit here and say I’m sorry to all of those women, I can also say thank you. Without them and without the Bachelor franchise, I don’t know if this would have ever came out.”</p><p>When it came to Randolph, specifically, Underwood offered an apology. (Us Weekly confirmed in September 2020 that <a href=#>the Huntington Beach native was granted a restraining order against her ex,</a> which was dropped that November.)</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I loved everything about her and it’s hard for me to articulate exactly what my emotions were in going through that relationship with her was because I obviously had an internal fight going on,” he said. “I would just say that I’m sorry from the bottom of my heart. I’m sorry for any pain and emotional stress I caused. I wish that it wouldn’t have happened the way that it did. I wish that I had been courageous enough to fix myself before I broke anybody else.”</p><p>Scroll through for Underwood’s candid quotes about his sexuality over the years:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNksLC406ilZq2embKzw86om2annmK1qr%2BMrKurrZecuaZ51qKroWWjmsW2rcuiq7Jln6uys3nToZxmsZWWv7R7</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./enrique-iglesias-anna-kournikovas-family-album-with-kids-photos.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Enrique Iglesias, Anna Kournikovas Family Album With Kids: Photos</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-devanne-villarreal-meet-davante-adams-wife-on-instagram.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who Is Devanne Villarreal?
