Once many of those fans finished watching that season, they quickly went online to learn <a href=#>what went on behind the scenes</a> and to express their opinion of the latest episodes.Given that the fourth season of Stranger Things was far scarier than what came before, it makes perfect sense that a lot of the discussion surrounded the season's main villain. Thanks to <a href=#>how much Jamie Campbell Bower committed to his role as Vecna</a>, most fans heaped praise on his performance.On the less frightening side of things, there also was a lot of discussion about one of Stranger Things' most adorable relationships. Chrissy Cunningham and Eddie Munson only appeared in one episode together and things went horribly awry, but most people thought they were still incredible together.Thanks to how much fans loved their characters together, people quickly grew to care about Grace Van Dien and Joseph Quinn. Perhaps the most notable thing that a lot of fans wondered about is the nature of Quinn and Van Dien's relationship in real life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-did-joseph-quinn-and-grace-van-dien-think-of-starring-in-stranger-things>What Did Joseph Quinn And Grace Van Dien Think Of Starring In Stranger Things?</h2><p>During the fourth season of Stranger Things, fans of the show were introduced to a slew of new characters. Unfortunately for the people behind the show and fans alike, some of those characters didn't go over well including Jason Carver, Angela and Lt. Colonel Jack Sullivan.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What Did Stranger Things' Jamie Campbell Bower Really Think Of His Twilight Co-Stars?</a></span></p><p>On the bright side of things, there definitely were some characters that were introduced during the fourth season of Stranger Things that people embraced. Arguably the three characters who best meet that description are Vecna, Chrissy Cunningham, and Eddie Munson.</p><p>Once many Stranger Things viewers grew to love Chrissy and Eddie, there was interest in how the actors who portrayed them felt about their roles.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/jamie-campbell-bower-eduardo-franco-and-joseph-quinn.jpg><p>While speaking with Sixty Six magazine, Van Dien expressed how surprised and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">grateful she is by how most fans have embraced her</a> and her Stranger Things character.</p><p>“I didn’t think a role with a short amount of screen time would have the impact that it has had, but I’m very grateful for it. I get to travel all over the world to attend fan conventions and meet everyone who has been touched by the show. It’s been an amazing experience.”</p><p>Unsurprisingly, Quinn has repeatedly made it clear that he is incredibly thankful for what Stranger Things brought into his life. That said, Quinn has spoken about one aspect of starring in Stranger Things that he found frustrating.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Joseph Quinn Was Miserable Pretending To Be A Teenager In Stranger Things Season 4</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"He’s significantly younger than me and significantly not from south London.

Unfortunately, the reality of the situation is lots of actors who play friends actually <a href=#>can't stand each other behind the scenes</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>20 Surprising Facts About The Stranger Things Cast</a></span></p><p>During the fourth season of Stranger Things, Grace Van Dien and Joseph Quinn only appeared onscreen together briefly. Despite that, their characters shared such a surprising amount of chemistry that many fans were sincerely saddened that their time together was so brief.</p><p>When fans accepted that Chrissy and Eddie weren't going to have more time together, some of them hoped that at least the actors would become friends.</p><p>Given that most people don't walk around declaring that certain people are their friends, it shouldn't surprise anyone that Quinn and Van Dien aren't doing that. On the bright side, however, all the evidence points to the two actors developing a really sweet relationship.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While the majority of Stranger Things fans couldn't get enough of Eddie and Chrissy, that feeling wasn't universal. Of course, it is perfectly fair for anyone to disagree with the consensus feeling on fictional characters so that shouldn't have been a problem.</p><p>Sadly, however, a group of people somehow think it is fine to harass celebrities online.</p><p>Amazingly enough, it is well documented that Van Dien was harassed on social media. In fact, it is so well known that some fans who are disturbed by Van Dien's treatment have documented evidence of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the hate that has been directed at Grace</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/grace-van-dien-on-the-red-carpet.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One piece of evidence that Quinn and Van Dien share a tight bond is that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Joseph came out to defend Grace</a> during a Live Q&A. While speaking about the harassment that he labeled "awful" Quinn didn't hold back in his criticism.</p><p>“I was talking to her about it. The internet is a very unforgiving place. It’s a place where people can show a lot of support, or where people can rally around hatred and misinformation. It’s indicative of where we are culturally – just through association she was getting lambasted. It’s disgusting. I don’t know what to say other than it sucks.”</p><p>On top of Quinn defending Van Dien, Joseph's comments revealed that the two actors still talked to each other after they worked on Stranger Things together. Of course, that isn't too surprising since it turns out the two former co-stars seemingly enjoy appearing at comic-cons together.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At this point, it is abundantly clear that Van Dien has had some nasty experiences dealing with so-called "fans" and people in the entertainment industry. However, Van Dien seems to radiate happiness in the photos she has taken with comic-cons fans alongside Quinn.</p><p>On top of taking photos with fans, Quinn and Van Dien took a selfie that Grace posted on social media in 2022. While Van Dien later shut down her social media, fans saved the photo, so it is still possible to see how happy the two actors seemed that they were able to reunite.</p><p>Of course, Quinn and Van Dien are actors, so they theoretically could be pretending to have a lot of affection for one another. However, aside from the fact that they are actors, there is no reason to think that their bond is anything other than genuine.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGieq5mTmnq3rc1mm6KdnmK%2FprjAraCopqOdtrF51qKroWWapMCmvMdmqK6hnqN6tMDRmqWgnaJiwam1zaCqaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./elle-king-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-2-178303-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Elle King Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./10-amazing-stories-of-deadly-disaster-survivors.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>10 Amazing Stories Of Deadly Disaster Survivors</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./worlds-smallest-and-richest-countries-worth-visiting.html>10 Of The World's Smallest And Richest Countries</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breakfast-eatery-dessert-shop-headed-downtown-rock-hill.html>Breakfast eatery, dessert shop headed to downtown Rock Hill WSOC TV</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1430237-shannon-moore-is-6-years-sober-credits-wwe-for-saving-his-life.html>Shannon Moore Is 6 Years Sober, Credits WWE For Saving His Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./laconic-crossword-clue-99949425.html>Laconic Crossword Clue - News</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lionel-messi-world-cup-argentina-final.html>Lionel Messi doesnt need the ball to hurt you</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JotBlog.
