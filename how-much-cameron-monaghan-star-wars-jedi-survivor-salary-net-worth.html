The <a href=#>actor played the Joker on Gotham</a> and then voiced a character in the video games <strong><a href=#>Star Wars</a></strong> Jedi: Fallen Order and Star Wars Jedi: Survivor.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Being involved with any project in the Star Wars franchise is likely incredibly exciting for an actor. But it often means a big payday.</p><p>Did Cameron Monaghan receive a lot of money to appear in Star Wars Jedi: Survivor? No matter what his paycheck was, one thing is for sure: his acting career is only going to get better and better.</p><h2 id=what-was-cameron-monaghan-39-s-star-wars-jedi-survivor-salary>What Was Cameron Monaghan's Star Wars Jedi: Survivor Salary?</h2><p>Just like <a href=#>Star Wars helped Alden Ehrenreich's career</a>, appearing in Star Wars Jedi: Survivor was a great move for Cameron Monaghan. He voiced Cal Kestis, whose storyline involves working up to Jedi Knight status and teaming up with other characters along the way.</p><p>Although his salary hasn't been made available, it's possible to guess that he was paid pretty well, given the fandom that the Star Wars franchise has.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to Celebrity Net Worth, the actor's net worth is $5 million. That is from his years starring on Malcolm in the Middle and Shameless and appearing in a few movies. And some of that, of course, comes from the two Stars Wars video games that he voiced a popular character in.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/cameron-monaghan-elton-john-foundation.jpg><p>According to The Hollywood Reporter, many <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">actors are happy to voice video game characters</a> because they like how smart the writing is. And as video games get better and more interesting, actors are taking notice and adding these types of projects to their resumes.</p><p>Monaghan told The Hollywood Reporter, “Games are interesting a lot of young artists right now who want to use this medium in a way that hasn’t really been used before."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Hollywood Reporter said that as of July 2018, actors who belong to SAG-AFTRA will be paid $3,150 weekly to voice a character in a video game. That is the least that they can be paid, so in many cases, their earning potential is higher.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>George Lucas Isn't Leaving Much of His Multi-Billion Dollar Star Wars Fortune To His Kids, Here's Why</a></span></p><p>No matter what Monaghan was paid, he probably felt that it was worth it both financially and creatively. And being involved with a Star Wars project of any sort definitely looks good on his resume. It's possible to assume that it will lead to even more incredible opportunities in the future and that he will have his pick of roles as more people are now familiar with him.</p><h2 id=how-did-star-wars-jedi-survivor-change-cameron-monaghan-39-s-career>How Did Star Wars Jedi: Survivor Change Cameron Monaghan's Career?</h2><p>It sounds like Cameron Monaghan enjoyed voicing Cal in Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order and Star Wars Jedi: Survivor. And this was definitely a smart career move.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After playing Ian Gallagher for 11 seasons of Shameless, the actor was likely thinking about what's next when he knew that the show would end in 2021. Monaghan's Star Wars video game role has risen his profile quite a lot and he has gotten a lot of attention as a result.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>George Lucas Refused To Speak To Original Darth Vader Actor David Prowse, Here's What Really Caused Their Bitter Feud</a></span></p><p>While Monaghan has starred in many movies, including 2014's Vampire Academy and the 2017 horror movie Amityville: The Awakening, there's no denying that the Star Wars name is much bigger than anything he has been part of. In 2018, he played a main character in the movie Anthem of a Teenage Prophet alongside Peyton List. Of course it's great to be cast in a movie, especially in a main role. But it's possible that many haven't heard of this film, which didn't make much of an impact.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/cameron-monaghan-last-of-us-premiere.jpg><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Monaghan talked about Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</a> in an interview with Entertainment Weekly in 2022 and said that he knew that he would most likely be part of a second Star Wars video game.</p><p>When asked about how he has a mustache in real life and his character does too, the actor agreed that as he matured, so did Cal. Monaghan also shared that he is a huge Star Wars fan and it was great to be cast. He said, "It's amazing. I grew up loving Star Wars as a kid. I mean, I guess everybody did, right?"</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Adam Driver Had A Bizarre Connection To Brad Pitt Before He Became Famous For Playing Kylo Ren In Star Wars</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Monaghan continued to Entertainment Weekly, "There were always new, exciting facets of this universe being introduced, and now we're getting to see that explored through many forms of media. There's some really cool stuff being done on Disney+, and it's not only one of the coolest things happening in Star Wars, but one of the coolest things happening in television at the moment."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/cameron-monaghan-smiling.jpg><p>As for how voicing a character in two Star Wars video games will alter Cameron Monaghan's future career, he could be cast in a Stars Wars movie in the future. And he would likely receive a fairly good salary for that film.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Variety reported some of the Star Wars actor salaries. According to the publication, John Boyega and Daisy Ridley made $100,000-$300,000 for The Force Awakens. This is a typical payment for someone who hasn't appeared in the Star Wars franchise before. It's possible to assume that if Monaghan was cast in a future project, he would be paid around the same. And if he was cast in more Star Wars movies, he would likely earn even more.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/cameron-monaghan.jpg><p>The Star Wars audience is also hoping that Cameron Monaghan could be cast in a Star Wars movie. According to Fandomwire.com, many people tweeted that they would love to see the actor reprise his role of Cal Kestis because he looks so much like him.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When asked by Entertainment Weekly if he would agree to take on Cal in a live-action Star Wars movie, Monaghan agreed that he would. He said, "What happens or where Star Wars wants to go from there is anybody's guess, but I can say I love Cal and it's been a joy finding him over the past few years. So we'll see."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9dosKktIycmKadoqS7brnOp5igoJGjerTAwKtksJmiqHqrscOiZKytoqu2t7vRZqqapJGnxm66xK1ksKeiqbVw</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./david-blaine.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>David Blaine News - Us Weekly</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./anna-nicole-smith-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Anna Nicole Smith Net Worth How Much is Smith Worth?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./worlds-smallest-and-richest-countries-worth-visiting.html>10 Of The World's Smallest And Richest Countries</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breakfast-eatery-dessert-shop-headed-downtown-rock-hill.html>Breakfast eatery, dessert shop headed to downtown Rock Hill WSOC TV</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1430237-shannon-moore-is-6-years-sober-credits-wwe-for-saving-his-life.html>Shannon Moore Is 6 Years Sober, Credits WWE For Saving His Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./laconic-crossword-clue-99949425.html>Laconic Crossword Clue - News</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lionel-messi-world-cup-argentina-final.html>Lionel Messi doesnt need the ball to hurt you</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JotBlog.
