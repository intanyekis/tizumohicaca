The center, which was founded shortly after the murder of George Floyd in 2020, has raised tens of millions of dollars to finance a number of projects, including graduate programs, a racial disparities database and a media venture.</p><p>While some of these projects have come to completion, others have not, including the database, which some have described as the “centerpiece” of the organization.</p><p>"I don't know where the money is," a Boston University professor who previously worked at the center <a href=# title=https://www.bostonglobe.com/2023/09/20/metro/following-layoffs-boston-university-announces-inquiry-into-ibram-kendis-antiracist-center/ class=themeColorForLinks>told The Boston Globe</a>.</p><p><strong>READ MORE | <a href=# title=https://thenationaldesk.com/news/americas-news-now/antiracism-book-removed-from-nc-school-district-classrooms-develop-opinions-off-of-the-facts-north-carolina-new-hanover-county-schools-stamped-racism-ibram-x-kendi-jason-reyonds# class=themeColorForLinks>'Antiracism' book removed from NC school district classrooms: 'Develop opinions off of the facts'</a></strong></p><p>The investigation follows Kendi laying off more than half of center staff last week after returning from leave, prompting several to voice complaints about dysfunction within the organization.<br></p><p>“It was one of the most difficult decisions of my career to execute these layoffs,” Kendi <a href=# title=https://www.axios.com/2023/09/21/ibram-kendi-center-layoffs class=themeColorForLinks>told </a>Axios. He explained, however, that the decision was made to “ensure that the Center of Antiracist Research will be around 50 years from now."</p><p>Kendi accused those laid off of being “disgruntled,” and he said their complaints have no footing.</p><p>“I'm really devastated, both because of having to lay people off, but then also because there's certainly disgruntled people who are sort of using the moment to express problems.

"We recognize the importance of Dr. Kendi’s work and the significant impact it has had on antiracist thinking and policy. Boston University and Dr. Kendi believe strongly in the Center’s mission, and while he takes strong exception to the allegations made in recent complaints and media reports, we look forward to working with him as we conduct our assessment."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmihlJa1sLrEsKpnm5%2BifK%2Bx1qxmp5mknryvedaoqaWcX56vs63MZq9mo5Wjsaq%2FjJqlraGilrCqv8xmmp6mpJq%2FbsHNnZyrZZmjw6a%2F06KemqyZpLturcWtnKtlk6S6sbjAoqWtq12Wr7DB02aarqSkqr%2BmecarmKesXaKur63GnqSepqRirq%2FAyKuYnKGjqXqju9KtpqdlpaO2t7HRrKCtsV2owaK5z56bZpqfpLg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kylie-jenner-mansion-khloe-kardashian-kris-jenner-compound.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Kylie Jenner Builds Mansion Near Khloe Kardashian &amp;amp; Kris Jenner's Compound</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./david-blaine.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>David Blaine News - Us Weekly</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./worlds-smallest-and-richest-countries-worth-visiting.html>10 Of The World's Smallest And Richest Countries</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breakfast-eatery-dessert-shop-headed-downtown-rock-hill.html>Breakfast eatery, dessert shop headed to downtown Rock Hill WSOC TV</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1430237-shannon-moore-is-6-years-sober-credits-wwe-for-saving-his-life.html>Shannon Moore Is 6 Years Sober, Credits WWE For Saving His Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./laconic-crossword-clue-99949425.html>Laconic Crossword Clue - News</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lionel-messi-world-cup-argentina-final.html>Lionel Messi doesnt need the ball to hurt you</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JotBlog.
