And prove yourself.’”</p><p>After the owner of a nearby business confirmed to the officer that the couple owned the store, the disagreement between the two was resolved.</p><p>But it was after a video of the event went viral, that the Tiburon police department received backlash, causing a police sergeant to quit.</p><p>Read Also:&nbsp;<a href=#>Kenyan In US Dies In Tragic Accident While Fleeing After Stabbing Wife</a></p><p>Khalif and Awash sued for $2 million last year, alleging emotional pain, possible revenue loss, and punitive damages.</p><p>Last Monday, the city of Tiburon struck a $150,000 settlement with the victims as well as a commitment to make Marin County more inclusive.</p><p>Tiburon intends to establish a community advisory group to help select candidates for the Tiburon police force.
