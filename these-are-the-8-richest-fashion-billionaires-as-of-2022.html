However, when discussing fashion, one must also mention the most prominent retailers, such as Inditex, H&M, Nike, or Uniqlo. The global fashion sector is valued at $2.5 trillion, which begs the question: <a href=#>how wealthy are the industry's titans</a>? Whether they are pioneers, designers, executives, or successors, the fashion industry's wealthiest individuals own the majority of the companies people covet. In recent years, the fortunes of the <a href=#>fashion industry's wealthiest individuals</a> have increased substantially. Now, let’s see who are the richest fashion billionaires in 2022!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=stefan-persson-20-7-billion>Stefan Persson – $20.7 Billion</h2><p>Carl Stefan Erling Persson is now ranked as the 84th richest person in the world, as compiled by Forbes in their Billionaire's List for the year 2022. The former chairman of the fashion firm Hennes & Mauritz (H&M) is currently the wealthiest person in Sweden. In May of 2020, he stepped aside as chairman of H&M and let his son, Karl-Johan, assume control of this fast-fashion company. Despite having over 5,000 locations in 74 countries, the Swedish company still has a great deal of space for expansion. This is because virtually everyone around the globe is familiar with H&M and has expressed an interest in purchasing some of their products.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=tadashi-yanai-29-2-billion>Tadashi Yanai – $29.2 Billion</h2><p>Tadashi Yanai, the richest person in Japan, founded and leads Fast Retailing, the parent business of Uniqlo, t<a href=#>he largest clothing retailer in all of Asia</a>.

More than three decades after beginning his career at his father's roadside tailor shop, his company's yearly revenue tops $21.3 billion. However, he has always aspired high, and he expects that one day Fast Retailing will beat H&M and Inditex.</p><h2 id=gerard-amp-alain-wertheimer-33-5-billion-each>Gerard & Alain Wertheimer – $33.5 Billion (Each)</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>People have appropriately referred to this pair as "<a href=#>the quietest billionaires in fashion</a>." The Wertheimer brothers are the mystery co-owners of Chanel, with Alain serving as the head of this illustrious fashion brand and Gerard overseeing Chanel's watch department in Switzerland. In addition to their enormous fashion company, Gerard and Alain also control multiple wineries in France and Napa Valley.

Today, Nike is the largest manufacturer of athletic shoes and sportswear in the world, with over 1,100 outlets and over $44 billion in revenue.
