The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">former "America's Got Talent" host</a> comes from a big family of four siblings, including his younger brother, Gabriel. Despite suffering a number of trials and tribulations in order to make it in Hollywood like his big bro, Gabriel Cannon has been met with some difficult times. When it comes to Nick Cannon's relationship with Gabriel, just how close are they?</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>15 Things Nick Cannon Has Recently Admitted</a></span></p><h2 id=a-rocky-relationship>A Rocky Relationship</h2><p>Nick Cannon grew up with quite a big family! Cannon, who was raised by both his mother, father, and grandfather, alongside his brothers, Gabriel, Reuben and Caleb, didn't always live such a luxurious life. The star was affiliated with gangs growing up, however through the church, he and his brothers were able to find a place to feel safe and comfortable in, leading the bunch to sing and perform countless church songs.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It was at this time that the group began to venture out into music and even <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">created a group of their own called "3YB",</a> known as the "Three Young Brothers". The camera was said to always have been rolling when the kids were young, which is exactly where Nick formed a liking for entertainment. It didn't take too much time before Nick Cannon made it big in Hollywood and found himself on Nickelodeon. His brothers were instant fans and "idolized" him, said younger brother Gabriel, however their relationship suffered due to their brothers increasing fame.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>Here's How Nick Cannon Amassed His Reported $50 Million Net Worth</a></span></p><p>Although jealousy and resentment are oftentimes seen amongst family members who succeed more than others, that was never the case for the Cannons. Gabriel Cannon had nothing but love and respect for Nick's grind and wanted more for himself. It was at this moment that Nick had given his brothers opportunities in the business, taking care of Nick's career behind the scenes, and even setting up Gabriel with his very own rap group, Writerz N Artists.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While things may have worked out at the beginning of Nick's career, everything took a turn when the brothers began butting heads. Gabriel was once kicked out of the recording booth and out of the group for good. He yearned to be as famous as his big brother, but that simply did not appear to be in the cards for him. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Gabriel was arrested a few years later </a>after having stollen camera equipment from Alex Moreno, who worked in reality television at the time.</p><p>It was at this point that Gabriel no longer wanted to chase fame and built his relationship with God back up. During these years, Gabriel and Nick had a falling out, and Gabriel was nowhere to be found during Nick's troubles through his divorce and health issues, putting further strain on their relationship.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=#>10 Hollywood Women Nick Cannon Is Close To (10 He Stays Away From)</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibqJ2jYruqr8pmmpqmnqS7brTAr5xmmV2nsq2t06Kmp6uYnr1uw8itn2agmah6o77OrZ%2Beql2crqO%2ByJ6jaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./chris-young-texas-rangers-contenders.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>How GM Chris Young pushed the Rangers back to contention: He keeps the throttle down</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./chrisean-rock-sued-assaulting-tamar-braxtons-backup-singer-1234849610.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Chrisean Rock Sued For Assaulting Tamar Braxton Singer, James Wright</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./worlds-smallest-and-richest-countries-worth-visiting.html>10 Of The World's Smallest And Richest Countries</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breakfast-eatery-dessert-shop-headed-downtown-rock-hill.html>Breakfast eatery, dessert shop headed to downtown Rock Hill WSOC TV</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1430237-shannon-moore-is-6-years-sober-credits-wwe-for-saving-his-life.html>Shannon Moore Is 6 Years Sober, Credits WWE For Saving His Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./laconic-crossword-clue-99949425.html>Laconic Crossword Clue - News</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lionel-messi-world-cup-argentina-final.html>Lionel Messi doesnt need the ball to hurt you</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JotBlog.
