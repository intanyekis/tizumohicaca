Michelle and her husband David E. Kelley share two children; Claudia Rose Pfeiffer and John Henry Kelley.</p><p>Though many fans of Michelle know her daughter as Claudia Rose Pfeiffer, it appears Claudia took her dad's last name; she sometimes goes by Claudia Kelley. Who is Claudia, and what is she doing for a living now that she's an adult out of her famous mom's shadow?</p><h3 id=update-2023-06-27-22-46-est-by-lane-vasquez>UPDATE: 2023/06/27 22:46 EST BY LANE VASQUEZ</h3><p><strong>Claudia Rose Pfeiffer Lives A Quiet, Academic Life Outside Hollywood</strong></p><p>While Claudia Rose Pfeiffer, AKA Claudia Kelley, is the daughter of famous parents, she opts to stay out of the spotlight and focus on her academic interests and career.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=not-much-is-known-about-michelle-pfeiffer-39-s-adopted-daughter>Not Much Is Known About Michelle Pfeiffer's Adopted Daughter</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/john-kelley-david-e-kelley-michelle-pfeiffer-claudia-kelley.jpg><p>When she was 35 years old, Michelle adopted a baby girl named Claudia Rose. Then, she gave birth to her biological son John Henry a year later.</p><p>One could say that it's fate's work because it was during the adoption process that Michelle met her future husband, David E. Kelley, the creator of Ally McBeal and Boston Legal. Claudia Rose Pfeiffer is said to have been born in February 1993.</p><p>Her mother reportedly adopted her the following month. Later, Michelle and David then celebrated their wedding and Claudia's christening on the same day.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel=nofollow title="How Michelle Pfeiffer Was Taken In By A Vegetarian Cult">Michelle Pfeiffer Didn't Hate Working With George Clooney On One Fine Day, But She Had This Negative Thing To Say About Him</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Pfeiffer and Kelley have always led extremely public lives, and Pfeiffer has been very cautious to ensure that their daughter does not follow in their footsteps and has a career in the spotlight.</p><p>During the early stages of the adoption process, she encountered a great deal of prejudice due to her choice to adopt a child of mixed racial heritage. She expressed her astonishment that so many people continue to emphasize it.</p><p>Pfeiffer is one of many famous people who have spoken openly about the impact adoption has had on their lives and kept their word about keeping their children out of the spotlight.

During an interview, Michelle disclosed that when it came time for her children to leave the house, it was difficult to see them walk out into the world.</p><p>She stated that even though many people joke about an empty nest, the situation is complex. She remembered reading an interview with Dustin Hoffman; his first child had just gone to college, and he remarked that nobody talks about their empty room. Pfeiffer said she even felt like crying just thinking about it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel=nofollow title="How Michelle Pfeiffer Earns And Spends Her $250 Million Net Worth">How Michelle Pfeiffer Earns And Spends Her $250 Million Net Worth</a></span></p><p>Even though Pfeiffer was upset about seeing them go, she was confident in her parenting and believed she'd raised her kids to be strong individuals.</p><p>As for public outings, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Claudia attended a couple of red carpets</a> with her parents, specifically for the 82nd Academy Awards and the film premiere of her mother's film the Dark Shadows in 2012.
