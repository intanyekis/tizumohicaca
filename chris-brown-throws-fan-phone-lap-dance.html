The singer politely took the phone out of her hands before hitting his trademark dance moves. However, the fan couldn’t help herself and picked her phone back up to capture the moment.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>As he got closer to the woman, Brown grabbed her phone again — only this time launching it into the audience as the venue’s lights dimmed down. The woman looked confused, and it didn’t take long for people to talk about the situation on social media.</p><p>Even Chris Brown himself shared the footage on his Instagram Story with a caption that read: “FUCK DAT PHONE.”</p><a title=@ellishatok href=# rel=noopener>@ellishatok</a><a title=chrisbrown href=# rel=noopener>#chrisbrown</a> throws fans <a title=phone href=# rel=noopener>#phone</a><a title="♬ original sound - Ellisha Tok" href=# rel=noopener>♬ original sound – Ellisha Tok</a><p>Fortunately, the fan was able to recover her phone at the end of the show thanks to a fellow concert-goer who had held onto it, as seen in a video shared online.</p><p>Brown once again saw the footage and took to his IG Story to react, writing: “Shawty got her phone back too..” along with a crying face emoji.</p><p>The <a class=underline-link href=# rel=noopener>Breezy</a> singer isn’t the only artist to have tossed a fan’s phone off stage.

According to Joey Crack, those fans need to start living in the moment.</p><p>“If you go to a show, and you pull your camera out and you’re recording, you’re not really in the moment,” Joe said. “You’re recording what’s going on.
