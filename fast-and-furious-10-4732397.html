The tenth film in the Fast & Furious film pits Dom against someone from his past. After dropping the first official trailer in February 2023 (and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>a Super Bowl spot</a>), the second trailer was released on April 19.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Dom will be going head-to-head with Dante, played by<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong> Jason Momoa</strong></a>, who is out for revenge because Dom killed his father, Herman Reyes. Dante is an agent of chaos, and he’s not afraid to go to great lengths for vengeance. “The game’s over, Dom. You lose,” Dante says in the trailer. Dom and Dante will take the to the streets to settle things, and we got a glimpse of a massive truck explosive over a dam in the latest footage. Plus, <strong>Jason Statham’s</strong> Shaw is getting in on the action.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>All good things must come to an end, though. Sadly, that includes the <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Fast & Furious</a>&nbsp;franchise. The upcoming eleventh film, which doesn’t have a release date, will be the final film in the franchise. But for now, all eyes are on Fast X. <strong>HollywoodLife</strong> has rounded up everything we know so far.</p><h2>Release Date</h2><p id=content-paragraph-5>Fast X is scheduled to be released in theaters on May 19, 2023. That’s just under two years after&nbsp;F9&nbsp;was released in June 2021 and became one of the highest-grossing films of the <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>COVID-19 pandemic</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Fast X&nbsp;was supposed to arrive in April 2021 but was postponed due to the pandemic. It was later set for an April 7, 2023 release date until December 2021, when the film was pushed back again to May 2023. The movie will be released exclusively in theaters.</p><h2>Cast & Crew</h2><h3><strong>Vin Diesel as Dom Toretto</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/fast-x-new-trailer-embed2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-7>All your favorite cast members will be back for&nbsp;Fast X. That includes <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Vin Diesel</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;</strong>as Dom Toretto. He has appeared in every&nbsp;Fast & Furious&nbsp;film thus far, and since <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Paul Walker</strong></a>‘s death, the franchise has truly revolved around Vin.</p><h3><strong>Michelle Rodriguez as Letty Ortiz</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Fast-Furious-Michelle-Rodriguez-shutter-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-8><a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Michelle Rodriguez</strong></a>&nbsp;is back as Dom’s wife, Letty Ortiz. Michelle has become a crucial part of the film franchise and her character remains a fan-favorite through the first nine films.</p><h3><strong>Tyrese Gibson as Roman Pearce</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Fast-Furious-Tyrese-Gibson-shutter-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-9><a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Tyrese Gibson</strong></a>&nbsp;is returning as expert street racer Roman Pearce. This will mark Tyrese’s seventh appearance in the&nbsp;Fast & Furious&nbsp;films. At the end of F9, Roman and Tej reached the International Space Station and then returned to Earth.</p><h3><strong>Nathalie Emmanuel as Ramsey</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Fast-Furious-Nathalie-Emmanuel-shutter-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-10>Also returning for&nbsp;Fast X is <strong>Nathalie Emmanuel&nbsp;</strong>as British computer hacker Ramsey. Nathalie, who is best known for her role as Missandei in&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Game of Thrones</a>, joined&nbsp;Fast & Furious&nbsp;for&nbsp;Furious 7 in 2015. She reprised the role in the following two films, and now she’s back for more.</p><h3><strong>Sung Kang as Han Lue</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Fast-Furious-Sung-Kang-shutter-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-11><strong>Sung&nbsp;</strong><b>Kang </b>is back as Dom’s ally&nbsp;Han Lue. Han last appeared in&nbsp;F9&nbsp;after having successfully faked his death with help from Mr. Nobody. At the end of the film, <strong>Jason Statham</strong>‘s Deckard Shaw is shocked to learn that Han is in fact alive.</p><h3><strong>Jordana Brewster as Mia Toretto</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Fast-Furious-Jordana-Brewster-shutter-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-12>It wouldn’t be a&nbsp;Fast & Furious&nbsp;film without <strong><a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Jordana Brewster</a>&nbsp;</strong>as Dom’s sister Mia Toretto. But Vin did reveal that Jordana was <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>nearly written out of the film</a>. She kept the role, according to Vin, thanks to one of his daughters who spoke up to original director&nbsp;Justin Tan.</p><h3><strong>Charlize Theron as Cipher</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Fast-Furious-Charlize-Theron-shutter-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-13><strong><a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Charlize Theron</a>&nbsp;</strong>will make another appearance as Cipher, the criminal cyberterrorist&nbsp;who was the main villain of&nbsp;The Fate of the Furious. She escaped at the end of the film, so&nbsp;Fast X&nbsp;will surely reintroduce her with many questions answered.</p><h3><strong>Ludacris as Tej Parker</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Fast-Furious-Ludacris-shutter-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-14><a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Ludacris</strong></a>&nbsp;returns for Fast X&nbsp;as mechanic Tej Parker. This will mark Tej’s seventh appearance in the film franchise. As mentioned before,&nbsp;F9&nbsp;ended with him and Roman traveling to space.</p><h3><strong>Michael Rooker as Buddy</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Fast-Furious-Michael-Rooker-shutter-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-15>Buddy is back! <strong>Michael Rooker</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong>is returning as the auto mechanic first introduced in&nbsp;F9. Buddy is an old family friend of the Torettos, so it’ll be fun to see more of his interactions with Dom and Mia.</p><h3><b>Scott Eastwood as Eric Reisner/Little Nobody</b></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Fast-Furious-Scott-Eastwood-shutter-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-16><strong><a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Scott Eastwood</a>&nbsp;</strong>will reprise his role as law enforcement agent Eric Reisner, also known as Little Nobody. He previously appeared in&nbsp;Fate of the Furious&nbsp;who worked for Mr. Nobody, played by <strong><a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Kurt Russell</a></strong>. It’s unclear if Kurt is also returning for&nbsp;Fast X.</p><h3><b>Cardi B as Leysa</b></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Fast-Furious-Cardi-B-shutter-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-17>It’s not one-and-done for <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Cardi B</strong></a>. The rapper will star in&nbsp;<i>Fast X</i> as Leysa, who originated in the last film. Leysa is an old friend of Dom’s who helped rescue him in&nbsp;F9. Hopefully she can save the day once again!</p><h3><b>Rita Moreno as Dom’s grandmother</b></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Fast-Furious-Rita-Moreno-shutter-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-18>There will be a few new cast members in&nbsp;Fast X, starting with&nbsp;Oscar winner <strong><a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Rita Moreno</a></strong>, 90. She’s joining the&nbsp;Fast and Furious&nbsp;franchise as Dom and Mia’s grandmother.

Vin said it’s been his “dream forever” to work with Rita.</p><h3><strong>Jason Momoa as Dante&nbsp;</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Fast-Furious-Jason-Momoa-shutter-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-19>Aquaman star <strong><a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Jason Momoa</a> </strong>is playing the villain, Dante, in Fast X.&nbsp;“He’s amazing.

Then I get to go to some cool places, obviously work with the whole cast, but yeah I’m excited working with Vin.”</p><h3><strong>Brie Larson</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Fast-Furious-Brie-Larson-shutter-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-20>Captain Marvel actress <strong><a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Brie Larson</a> </strong>has been cast in an undisclosed role.

It was also rumored that <strong><a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Tom Holland</a>&nbsp;</strong>was being sought out to join&nbsp;Fast & Furious 10, but it’s not expected that the <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Spider-Man: No Way Home</a>&nbsp;appears in the film. Fans are also hoping that Paul Walker’s daughter,&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Meadow Walker</strong></a>&nbsp;makes her film debut in Fast X.&nbsp;Paul&nbsp;played Brian O’Conner in the franchise until his death in 2013.</p><h3><strong>Crew</strong></h3><p id=content-paragraph-24>Director&nbsp;<strong>Justin Lin</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong>was initially set to return for&nbsp;Fast X. He previously directed five&nbsp;Fast & Furious&nbsp;movies, including 2006’s&nbsp;Tokyo Drift and 2021’s&nbsp;F9. However, after one week of filming, Justin exited as the director due to “creative differences,” though he remains on the film as a producer. He’s also writing the film alongside <strong>Dan&nbsp;Mazeau</strong>.&nbsp;<strong>Louis Leterrier</strong>, who directed the first two&nbsp;Transporter&nbsp;films and&nbsp;The Incredible Hulk,&nbsp;officially replaced Justin as director on May 2. <i>Fast X&nbsp;</i>producers include Justin, Vin, <strong>Neal H. Moritz, Joe Roth, Jeff</strong> <strong>Kirschenbaum,</strong> <strong>Clayton Towsend</strong>, and&nbsp;<strong>Samantha Vincent</strong>. Universal Pictures is distributing the film.</p><h2>Plot Information</h2><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p id=content-paragraph-25>The official synopsis for the film reads: “Over many missions and against impossible odds, Dom Toretto and his family have outsmarted, out-nerved, and outdriven every foe in their path. Now, they confront the most lethal opponent they’ve ever faced: a terrifying threat emerging from the shadows of the past who’s fueled by blood revenge, and who is determined to shatter this family and destroy everything—and everyone—that Dom loves, forever.</p><p id=content-paragraph-26>In 2011’s Fast Five, Dom and his crew took out nefarious Brazilian drug kingpin Hernan Reyes and decapitated his empire on a bridge in Rio De Janeiro. What they didn’t know was that Reyes’ son, Dante, witnessed it all and has spent the last 12 years masterminding a plan to make Dom pay the ultimate price. Dante’s plot will scatter Dom’s family from Los Angeles to the catacombs of Rome, from Brazil to London, and from Portugal to Antarctica. New allies will be forged and old enemies will resurface. But everything changes when Dom discovers that his own 8-year-old son is the ultimate target of Dante’s vengeance.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/fast-x-new-trailer-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-27>It has been confirmed, though, that the final story in the Fast & Furious&nbsp;franchise will be split across the tenth and eleventh films. That means&nbsp;Fast X&nbsp;will probably end in a major cliffhanger. “Part of the reason why Fast 10 has to be broken into two different movies is because there’s so much ground to cover,” Vin revealed at&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>a press event</a> for F9&nbsp;in April 2021.&nbsp;“There’s so many places and so many locations in the world that we have to visit.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-28>The ninth movie ended with Tej and Roman reaching the International Space Station and then returning to Earth. Dom and his sister Mia reconciled with their brother Jakob after they stop him from destroying the world. Plus, Han discovered that Deckard is actually alive. These storylines, plus more, should carry on in Fast X.</p><h2>Filming Details</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/fast-x-new-trailer-embed3.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-29>Filming for&nbsp;Fast X began on April 20, 2022. Vin celebrated by sharing the movie’s official title,&nbsp;Fast X, on Instagram. “Day one…,” he <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>wrote</a> alongside the visual title. Some filming took place in London and then in Rome, where Jason was <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>spotted sightseeing</a> with friends during a work break.&nbsp;Fast X&nbsp;should wrap production at some point later in 2022. Then, the gang will likely get right to work on the eleventh movie, which is scheduled for release in 2024.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8Waqq1lkaOxbrLUq6CoraNifnF5k3Bqa2tpbHw%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./tom-bradys-model-admirer-veronika-rajek-upset-with-gisele-bundchen-comparisons.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Tom Brady's model admirer, Veronika Rajek, upset with Gisele Bndchen comparisons</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./eddie-hearn-net-worth-bio-wiki-age-height-family-wife-and-anthony-joshua.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Eddie Hearn Net Worth: Bio, Wiki, Age, Height, Family, Wife, and Anthony Joshua</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./worlds-smallest-and-richest-countries-worth-visiting.html>10 Of The World's Smallest And Richest Countries</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breakfast-eatery-dessert-shop-headed-downtown-rock-hill.html>Breakfast eatery, dessert shop headed to downtown Rock Hill WSOC TV</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1430237-shannon-moore-is-6-years-sober-credits-wwe-for-saving-his-life.html>Shannon Moore Is 6 Years Sober, Credits WWE For Saving His Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./laconic-crossword-clue-99949425.html>Laconic Crossword Clue - News</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lionel-messi-world-cup-argentina-final.html>Lionel Messi doesnt need the ball to hurt you</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JotBlog.
