He's also the most followed person on Instagram. Then there's Georgina Rodriguez â€” the "woman of the most followed man in the world," as she described herself on her <strong><a href=#>Netflix</a></strong> reality show, I am Georgina.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Spanish influencer rose to fame after meeting the footballer in 2016. Before that, Ronaldo famously dated Russian model, Irina Shayk for five years. According to reports, they broke up because <a href=#>Shayk didn't get along with his mother</a>.</p><p>On the other hand, Rodriguez seems to have a good relationship with her future mother-in-law. She's even commended for taking such good care of <a href=#>Ronaldo's children from previous surrogates</a>. That's why fans find it odd that they still haven't tied the knot after seven years of being together.</p><p>But for now, let's take a closer look at Rodriguez's own tabloid headliners â€” from her rumored plastic surgery to the controversy surrounding her show.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Here's Why Fans Thought Bradley Cooper And Irina Shayk Were Getting Back Together</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=why-is-georgina-rodriguez-39-s-netflix-show-so-controversial>Why Is Georgina Rodriguez's Netflix Show So Controversial?</h2><p>Ahead of I am Georgina's season 2 premiere in March 2023, Rodriguez and Ronaldo drew flak over their "fake humility." During the former's appearance on the Spanish program El Hormiguero, she was asked about the gifts she usually gets from the latter. She then answered that they're "not materialistic" but her full statement might have proved otherwise.</p><p>"This year, he gave me his time. My birthday always falls on game nights so I spend a few of my birthdays with him," Rodriguez shared when asked what Ronaldo gave her for her birthday in January. "We spent my birthday together, with our kids, with our families."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/instar51930716.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Now, this is where it went wrong. When asked about the kind of presents she gives her partner, she said: "He's not very materialistic. We're not materialistic," to which the host quipped: "Well, he's not materialistic because he doesn't have anything left to buy. He has everything."</p><p>Fans were quick to pull up receipts of the couple being materialistic. One was that time Rodriguez bought Ronaldo a $350,000 Rolls Royce. "We're not materialistic but I've bought him three cars," said an internet sleuth. Another one commented: "Georgina in the anthill 'we are not at all materialistic' 2 minutes later: 'well, I have given Cristiano 3 cars' ðŸ¤¡ðŸ¤¡ðŸ¤¡."</p><p>Many have also branded her show "shallow" and "tacky" for showing so much of her luxurious lifestyle while being "like a D movie about the most NOT interesting person ever," per an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">IMDb review</a>. Still, some think it's interesting to see her journey where "I went from selling luxury goods to wearing them on the runway," as she proudly said in the first season.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Does Cristiano Ronaldo Have A Private Security Team (And How Much Does He Pay Them)?</a></span></p><h2 id=why-hasn-39-t-cristiano-ronaldo-married-georgina-rodriguez-yet>Why Hasn't Cristiano Ronaldo Married Georgina Rodriguez Yet?</h2><p>In one of the episodes of I am Georgina, the couple stated that they weren't in a rush to get married. When asked why the athlete hadn't popped the question yet, the two just laughed it off and said that it'll happen at the right time. But don't get them wrong, they're all in on this relationship.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/instar49915087.jpg><p>"I didn't think at the beginning that [the relationship] would be this strong. That I would fall in love with her," Ronaldo once said of Rodriguez in IAG. "I didn't expect it honestly. But after a while I felt that she was the woman of my life."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How Cristiano Ronaldo Was Scammed $300,000 By A Travel Agent For Trips He Never Took</a></span></p><p>Rodriguez is also happy with their current arrangement. "When I have him next to me, I have everything," she told Hola! of her relationship with the five-time Ballon d'Or recipient. "The children are our happiness â€” we wake up and the first thing we do is hug and kiss them."</p><h2 id=did-georgina-rodriguez-get-plastic-surgery>Did Georgina Rodriguez Get Plastic Surgery?</h2><p>There are rumors that Rodriguez had gone under the knife, several times, in the last few years. "Botox, injections, a Brazilian Butt Lift (BBL), and rhinoplasty were performed (nose job)," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Eduvast claimed</a>. "Her chin had been affected by the evident plastic surgery." The outlet also noted that the 29-year-old model had a smaller bust size before fame.</p><p>Rodriguez has never addressed the speculations but admitted to gaining weight since she first met Ronaldo. In her show, she openly talks about her love for food, especially when she's on holiday with her friends and family.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/0_georgina-rodriguez-looks-unrecognisable-in-throwback-snaps-before-meeting-cristiano-ronaldo-1.jpg><p>"I eat a lot and people have said to me: 'Why don't you go on a diet?'" she said in one of the episodes. "And I say: 'I? The energy with which I need to face one day.'" Her weakness? Iberian ham. She even brings some with her on their private jet. But speaking to Women's Health about her actual daily diet, she said:</p><p>"In the morning I have a French omelet with orange juice and coffee with milk. At mid-morning I have a banana, after training. To eat a puree, grilled meat, vegetables... For a snack, sometimes I have cans of cockles with lemon and for dinner, the same as for lunch."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibopxdmL%2Bqv9OimKenXae8r63LnaasZaees6Z5xp6mq5%2BZo65uvs6dqaKfpZrHbrPErWSsraKcsrPFjg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./zach-wilson-girlfriend-nicolette-dellanno-net-worth-tiktok-star.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>Â«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>How Zach Wilson's Girlfriend Nicolette Dellanno Really Makes All Her Money</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./courteney-cox-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;Â»</span><p class=pager__title>Courteney Cox Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./worlds-smallest-and-richest-countries-worth-visiting.html>10 Of The World's Smallest And Richest Countries</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breakfast-eatery-dessert-shop-headed-downtown-rock-hill.html>Breakfast eatery, dessert shop headed to downtown Rock Hill WSOC TV</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1430237-shannon-moore-is-6-years-sober-credits-wwe-for-saving-his-life.html>Shannon Moore Is 6 Years Sober, Credits WWE For Saving His Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./laconic-crossword-clue-99949425.html>Laconic Crossword Clue - News</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lionel-messi-world-cup-argentina-final.html>Lionel Messi doesnt need the ball to hurt you</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JotBlog.
