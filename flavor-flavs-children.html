He is a music producer and reality star who has featured on Growing Up Hip Hop” New York alongside his younger siblings and their father.</p><p>Focusing on his career, the New York native has honed playing more than 12 musical instruments over the years.

Like her father, Da’Zyna is a rapper and reality star who shared the screen with her popular father on Growing Up Hip Hop: New York. At the time producers of the show approached her to join the cast, they wanted only her but due to the cordial relationship between her and her siblings, she insisted on having them on the show.</p><p>While on the show, she acted as Quanah’s manager. Aside from this, she gave snippets into what it means to be the child of a popular parent, and in her case, it was her father. It turns out that it was not all glamor for the <span>32</span>-year-old as she had a troubled childhood. Her father neglected her and her siblings by refusing to pay child support as well as being a consistent parent in her life. It is not surprising that she was involved in fights to defend herself against bullies. Things got so difficult that she became homeless at some point.</p><p>She confronted her father for neglect during the first season of the reality show. Thankfully, both have since made up and can be seen flaunting their thriving relationship on social media.</p><p>Pertaining to her rap career, Da’Zyna goes by the name Kushy or Kushy Symone and has since released I Don’t Care on her Youtube channel in December 2022.</p><p>Regarding her love life, she has openly identified as bisexual, yet, not much is known about the man or woman in her life as of this writing.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Quanah_Drayton></span><strong>Quanah Drayton</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p><b readability=1><p>Personal Profile of Quanah Drayton</p><ul><li aria-level=1><span><strong>Full Name:</strong> Quanah Drayton</span></li><li aria-level=1><span><strong>Nickname:</strong> H2Flee, Fleezy</span></li><li aria-level=1><span><strong>Place of Birth:</strong> New York</span></li><li aria-level=1><span><strong>Parents:</strong> Flavor Flav and Angela ‘Angie’ Parker</span></li><li aria-level=1><span><strong>Siblings:</strong> 7, Shaniq, Kayla, Karren, William, Da’Zyna, Karma, Jordan</span></li><li aria-level=1><span><strong>Nationality:</strong> American</span></li><li aria-level=1><span><strong>Ethnicity:</strong> African American</span></li><li aria-level=1><span><strong>Religion:</strong> Christianity</span></li></ul></b></p><p>He shares the same mother as Da’Zyna and Williams. Like his older ones, his childhood was filled with many challenges. Quanah was diagnosed with autism, yet, this did not stop him from following his passion.</p><p>According to his Instagram bio, he is an artist. His online activities reveal that he launched a career as a rapper just like his father.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Karma_Drayton></span><strong>Karma Drayton</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p><b readability=1><p>Personal Profile of karmaDrayton</p><ul><li aria-level=1><span><strong>Full Name:</strong> Karma Drayton</span></li><li aria-level=1><span><strong>Date of Birth</strong>: 2007</span></li><li aria-level=1><span><strong>Age:</strong> 17 years old</span></li><li aria-level=1><span><strong>Place of Birth:</strong> New York</span></li><li aria-level=1><span><strong>Parents:</strong> Flavor Flav and Elizabeth ‘Liz’ Trujillo</span></li><li aria-level=1><span><strong>Siblings:</strong> 8, Shaniq, Kayla, Karren, William, Da’Zyna, Quanah, Jordan, Gibran Trujillo</span></li><li aria-level=1><span><strong>Nationality:</strong> American</span></li><li aria-level=1><span><strong>Ethnicity:</strong> African American</span></li><li aria-level=1><span><strong>Religion:</strong> Christianity</span></li></ul></b></p><p>He is the 7th child of the Don’t Believe the Hype rapper and Elizabeth ‘Liz’ Trujillo.

This forced Gammel to<a href=# rel=noopener> file a paternity suit</a> against the Flavor of Love Star at a Los Angeles court.&nbsp; According to Gammell, she filed for a paternity test at a Los Angeles Court because she needed money for Jordan’s everyday needs which he was not getting from his father.</p><p>In October, the result of the test conducted at LabCorp came back positive indicating that the rapper is the father.</p><p>Following this, <a href=# rel=noopener>TMZ reported</a> that a plan and custody agreement had been put in place.&nbsp; After he accepted that Jordan is his son, he was said to owe over $70 thousand in child support which had accumulated within the first two years of his son’s life. While the child is still <span>4</span> years old, the rapper has started teaching him how to play drums.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_is_the_Rappers_Wife></span><strong>Who is the Rapper’s Wife?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>As you would easily find, the Public Enemy hypeman had appeared on Flavor of Love, yet, when it came time to marry, he chose his 7th child’s mother, Trujillo, over other women that appeared on the show.</p><p>A closer look at her life shows that she is also a reality star who likes to maintain a quiet life making it hard to know the details about her background. As it is, even her birth year is not verified by the celebrity wife leading to the speculation that she was born in 1975.</p><p>During their marriage, the Hall of Famer had a close call with the law in 2012. Reportedly, he was <a href=# rel=noopener>arrested for assaulting</a> Trujillo and her son, Gibran Trujillo from another relationship. He allegedly threatened to kill Gibran when he took a kitchen knife and went after him. Yet after his arrest, he refuted any claims that he tried to kill Trujillo’s son.</p><p>Despite this, they tried to make the relationship work by going to therapy. They appeared on Couples Therapy, a reality series that showcases couples receiving therapy sessions. Their session proved quite vital as their marriage withstood the challenges and they forged ahead.</p><p>Moving forward, Trujillo collapsed during the shooting of Couples Therapy in April 2013. This led to speculations that it was a result of drug use and overdose of painkillers. However, it was later reported and linked to stress and an accidental overdose of painkillers. It would be recalled that he had his last child with another woman while still married to her, yet nothing has been heard about their parting ways.</p><p>At the moment the status of their marriage is unclear. The last time the rapper mentioned her was in 2016 when he celebrated their 12th year of being together.</p><p><h3 class=jp-relatedposts-headline>Related</h3></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiipaCyo8HGrGWcp51ks62t1aipZp6clsO0ecKhoKWcopq7cA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./missy-elliott-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Missy Elliott Net Worth - KahawaTungu</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./update-new-tasnim-ayeshas-viral-videos-on-telegram-exploring-the-full-content.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Exploring the Full Content The Talks Today</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./worlds-smallest-and-richest-countries-worth-visiting.html>10 Of The World's Smallest And Richest Countries</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breakfast-eatery-dessert-shop-headed-downtown-rock-hill.html>Breakfast eatery, dessert shop headed to downtown Rock Hill WSOC TV</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1430237-shannon-moore-is-6-years-sober-credits-wwe-for-saving-his-life.html>Shannon Moore Is 6 Years Sober, Credits WWE For Saving His Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./laconic-crossword-clue-99949425.html>Laconic Crossword Clue - News</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lionel-messi-world-cup-argentina-final.html>Lionel Messi doesnt need the ball to hurt you</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JotBlog.
