Cambry usually posts lifestyle and travel images.</p><p>Cambry was born on March 11, 1987, in the United States. Despite becoming permanently paralyzed from the waist down and losing control of her legs on June 21, 2005, Cambry has been enjoying a happy life.</p><p>Before the day of her accident, Kaylor had experienced the majority of her days as an international athlete. When she became paraplegic, she was just 18 years old.</p><p>When she was younger, she enjoyed practicing gymnastics and dancing while mounted on a moving horse.</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/admin.showbizcorner.com/uploads/2022/12/cambry-nelson-photo-as-an-horserider.webp></p><p>Cambry had such a passion for the activity that she spent the last ten years of her life honing her equestrian vaulting skills to compete at the highest level.</p><p>Besides her training in her interested field, she was also a ballerina and a member of a high school diving team. Before her injury, she had always dreamed of herself and her career as an athlete and horsewoman.</p><p>Cambry talked about how an accident caused her to have her biggest desire broken, eventually leading to her asking herself a question.</p><p>She was intrigued and asked the doctor a few things after finding herself in the accident she encountered. She then decided to receive the response she desired.</p><p>She asked a doctor if she might have children in the future, and the doctor said yes. Cambry asked the doctor again if she might ride a horse, as she felt at ease, and her curiosity wouldn't let up. She received a blank look from the doctor.</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/admin.showbizcorner.com/uploads/2022/12/cambry-nelson-and-her-affection-to-horse.webp></p><p>Kaylor even questioned whether she would ever make friends or have the opportunity to go on a date. In order to avoid making her friends late, she set out with them. It subsequently changed everything when she decided to start over.</p><p>For others to experience the passion, if not herself, she began instructing others. The Church of Jesus published her inspirational speech on her journey, and it is an entirely motivating and encouraging idea that everyone should have in their lives.</p><h2 id=zack-nelson-and-cambry-ka>Zack Nelson And Cambry Kaylor Relationship Timeline</h2><p>Zack posted a video of himself and his wife Cambry explaining how they met on his YouTube channel two years ago.</p><p>The couple made it apparent that they had met on a dating app, where Zack popped the question to Kaylor.
