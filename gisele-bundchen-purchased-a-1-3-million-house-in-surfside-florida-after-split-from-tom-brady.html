Since 2001, she has been one of the highest-paid models in the world, Gisele Bundchen says she is doing fine in light of her divorce from Tom Brady, in part because she is accustomed to doing things on her own.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With the divorce, "Gisele is dealing with issues that have been plaguing her for a long time," a source close to Bündchen tells PEOPLE.</p><p>The source explains that the split from Brady, 45, "was hard at first" for Bündchen, 42, "but enough time has passed that she is settling in."</p><p>The mother-of-two "has lived her own life for years while Tom played football so she is not afraid to do things by herself."</p><p>Bündchen's "main focus and priority" remain on the children, the source says. "Her mood is up and jovial around" son Benjamin Rein, 12½, and 9½-year-old daughter Vivian Lake, who the supermodel shares with Brady, per <a href=#><i>PEOPLE</i></a>.</p><p><span class=related-single><b>RELATED:</b><a href=#><b>Tom Brady & Gisele Have Finalized Their Divorce</b></a></span></p><p>"Gisele is great with her children and radiates happiness when either one or both are around," the source says, adding that "having them with her has helped her move ahead."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to the <i>insider</i>, "nothing is more important than" to Bündchen than the children's "happiness" during this time.

Per a three-page legal document obtained by PEOPLE, the petition for the dissolution of marriage was signed off by a judge in Glades County, Florida, who officially declared the marriage as dissolved and "irretrievably broken."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After a year of highly publicized marital problems, Gisele Bündchen and Tom Brady have now finalized their divorce after 13 years of marriage. But the Brazilian supermodel and seven-time Super Bowl champ apparently have been living separately for many months.</p><p>As first reported by the <a href=#><i>New York Post</i></a>, Bündchen quietly purchased a modest cottage in a small seaside town near Miami Beach for about $1.3 million a little over eight months ago, in February — or around two weeks before the formerly retired New England Patriots quarterback decided to make an NFL comeback with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.dirt.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/GiseleBundchenHouse_FL4.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Described as an “Art Deco-style cottage” in the listing, the stucco and terracotta-roof structure was built way back in 1940 but has since been “immaculately renovated.” Currently undergoing another makeover by Bündchen, according to records obtained by the Post, the modestly sized cottage has three bedrooms and an equal number of baths in 1,540 square feet of all-white, light-filled living space boasting hardwood floors throughout.</p><p>From the street out front, a brick driveway flanked by a postage stamp-sized lawn empties out at a short set of steps leading to a fairly unassuming front door. Once inside, an entry foyer steps down into an open-concept great room, which holds a living room sporting a faux brick fireplace and dining area, plus a kitchen outfitted with sleek white cabinetry, a subway tile backsplash, an oversized marble eat-in island, high-end stainless appliances, and glass sliders flowing out to an al fresco dining patio and grassy backyard. There’s also a master retreat sporting a bath equipped with dual vanities and a glass-encased shower, per <a href=#><i>Dirt</i></a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.dirt.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/GiseleBundchenHouse_FL7.jpg><p>Brady, 45, and Bündchen, 42, were married in 2009 and share three children — a son Benjamin, 12, and daughter Vivian, 9, along with another son Jack, 15, from Brady’s previous relationship with Bridget Moynahan.
