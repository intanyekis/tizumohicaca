We are devastated by his passing and trying our best to handle this in a way that allows us to grieve, protect our hearts, and celebrate every ounce of goodness about him. It seems impossible to move forward without him, but we must focus on the time we had, and bring to light his memory and beautiful soul. Thank you to everyone who has reached out and shared their memories and gracious words. We feel how much he was loved and how much he will be missed. We kindly ask for privacy during this excruciating time, and promise to update all on his celebration of life as details emerge. Thank you and much love to everyone.”</p><p>Original story below:&nbsp;</p><p>Actor Jeffrey Carlson is dead at 48. He was best known for his groundbreaking role as the daytime TV’s first transgender character on All My Children.</p><p>Time Out New York theater critic <strong>Adam Feldman</strong> was first to share the news on <a href=#>Twitter</a> on Sunday, July 9. A cause of death was not reported.</p><p>All My Children alum <strong>Eden Riegel</strong> was among the first to pay tribute to Carlson after his death. “Devastated beyond measure to hear of the passing of the beautiful and gifted Jeffrey Carlson,” Riegel wrote via <a href=#>Twitter</a> on Sunday. “I feel fortunate to have called this kind soul a friend and see his brilliant work up close. Gone far too soon — an unimaginable loss. Love you, Jeffrey. Rest friend.”</p><p>A Long Beach, California, native, Carlson studied acting at The University of California Davis, graduating in 1997, training in New York City at The Juilliard School. He appeared in several Broadway shows — including Tartuffe and Taboo — before making the jump to the screen. He had a guest spot on<a href=#> Law and Order: Special Victims Unit</a> as well as a small role in the 2005 romantic comedy Hitch before he scored his role on All My Children.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Actor-Jeffrey-Carlson-Dead-at-48-All-My-Childrens-Eden-Riegel-Mourns-Unimaginable-Loss-Inline.jpg><p>Carlson initially had a one-day job on <a href=#>the soap opera</a> as flamboyant British rockstar Zarf. Producers decided the theater veteran was perfect to take on the upcoming story arc for a trans character. Zarf returned to Pine Valley and developed feelings for Bianca (Riegel) and revealed that she actually identified as a woman. Zarf went on to change her name to Zoe.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I was very moved by it,” Carlson told the <a href=#>Los Angeles Times</a> of the story line in 2006. “If it creates a conversation, I think we’ve done our job.”</p><p>The story earned All My Children a GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding Daily Drama in 2007. Carlson wrapped up his run on the ABC soap later that year before returning to theater work.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaapJxiurp5wqGgpZyimru0ecmenZ%2Bqla56pK3Rpaqopl2ZsqKwjJqrZmxoYrqwwdGnnJ1lkq56pLvSrZirZw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./1415056-impact-bound-for-glory-will-ospreay-vs-speedball-mike-bailey-result.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>IMPACT Bound For Glory: Will Ospreay vs. Speedball Mike Bailey Result</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./lil-mo-husband-couples-court-549904.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>'Love &amp;amp; Hip-Hop''s Lil Mo, Husband Appear On 'Couples Court'</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./worlds-smallest-and-richest-countries-worth-visiting.html>10 Of The World's Smallest And Richest Countries</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breakfast-eatery-dessert-shop-headed-downtown-rock-hill.html>Breakfast eatery, dessert shop headed to downtown Rock Hill WSOC TV</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1430237-shannon-moore-is-6-years-sober-credits-wwe-for-saving-his-life.html>Shannon Moore Is 6 Years Sober, Credits WWE For Saving His Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./laconic-crossword-clue-99949425.html>Laconic Crossword Clue - News</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lionel-messi-world-cup-argentina-final.html>Lionel Messi doesnt need the ball to hurt you</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JotBlog.
