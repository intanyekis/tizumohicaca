A few of the stars who are regarded as the healthiest and who dedicate a fair amount of time to spreading the healthy lifestyle gospel actually <i>smoke</i>.&nbsp; They claim that it isn’t often, maybe one cigarette per week, but it is still a dangerous game to play, especially where addictive and carcinogenic substances are involved.</p><p>This being said, it was much more difficult than anticipated to find stars who eat well, exercise, <i>and</i> who do not engage in risky behavior such as smoking.&nbsp; The celebrities on this list satisfy all of these requirements and even do one better by sharing their knowledge with their families and the public, through speeches, television, magazines, books, and entrepreneurial ventures.</p><p>Here are 5 of the healthiest celebrities.</p><h2 id=5-bradley-cooper>5.&nbsp; Bradley Cooper</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It is well-known that <a title="Bradley Cooper Net Worth" href=#>Bradley Cooper</a> is an extremely talented Oscar-nominated actor who speaks French fluently, cares about the well-being of others, and who still manages to look great in a garbage bag.&nbsp; Though Cooper makes all of this seem easy, he has admitted to there being some bumps in the road, specifically about his own health and his struggle with alcoholism.&nbsp; He has been sober for a decade now, something that contributes immensely to his mental and physical health.&nbsp; In addition, he works out regularly, drinks 4-5 liters of water per day, and only consumes protein beverages that are made without chemicals and fillers.&nbsp; Not simply satisfied with concerning himself with his own health matters, he has also lobbied for Obamacare and mental health awareness.</p><p></p><h2 id=kourtney-kardashian>4. &nbsp;Kourtney Kardashian</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Kardashians receive a lot of criticism for everything they do on a daily basis, some of which is backed up and some of which is asinine.&nbsp; One thing is certain though, and that is that <a title="Kourtney Kardashian Net Worth" href=#>Kourtney Kardashian</a> is dedicated to being a healthy mom and having healthy kids.&nbsp; The 34 year-old is a busy mother of two young children, but that hasn't stopped her from maintaining a fitness regime and a healthy diet.&nbsp; Her favorite exercise is running, partially because she can do it wherever her busy schedule takes her.&nbsp; For meals, she often eats large salads full of veggies, proteins, and seeds but occasionally she and the kids indulge in organic grilled cheeses or home-made quesadillas.&nbsp; For the kids’ regular meals, Kardashian consults <i>Super Baby Food</i>, a book that contains hundreds of baby food recipes and tips about feeding young children.&nbsp; Another thing that is important to do with children and babies is avoiding harsh chemicals, which Kardashian does by using all-natural cleaning products.&nbsp; Even though Kourtney Kardashian is known as a reality television star, her top priority is being a great mom and she does this by keeping herself and her family healthy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=3-kelly-ripa>3.&nbsp; Kelly Ripa</h2><p>If you have ever seen any <i>Live!</i> episodes with <a title="Kelly Ripa Net Worth" href=#>Kelly Ripa</a>, you know that she can really hit the gym hard.&nbsp; Ripa will be 44 this year and most 20 year-olds could not keep up with her; in fact, 20 year-old Kelly wouldn't have been able to keep up either.&nbsp; During her twenties, Ripa cruised by without doing a whole lot with regards to her fitness, only to find that she couldn't keep up with her kids once she had them.&nbsp; A little distressed that it was too late for a woman in her thirties to start working out seriously, she started with simply walking on the treadmill.&nbsp; Then she started to jog, then run, then tone.&nbsp; Soon, all of her apprehensions of the past were gone and she emerged a very strong woman for her petite frame.&nbsp; Not only that, but she credits working out for calming down her brain and easing out her worries, which is a difficult task for a mom of three.&nbsp; She also eats organic foods, focusing on lots of vegetables and fish, while abstaining from sugar and processed foods.&nbsp; Fortunately for everyone else, Ripa shares all of this regularly with her viewers and still remains relatable and funny, despite the fact that she could double as Superwoman.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=2-cameron-diaz>2.&nbsp; Cameron Diaz</h2><p>It seems that <a title="Cameron Diaz Net Worth" href=#>Cameron Diaz</a> has always been known for being extremely fit.&nbsp; Ever since <i>Charlie’s Angels</i>, where she was whipped into shape by martial arts master Cheung-yan Yuen, she has displayed a body that is strong and toned, as well as a happy and confident mindset.&nbsp; Diaz admits that she wasn't always that way and that she struggled with healthy eating and exercise as a teenager and young adult.&nbsp; Now she is addicted to the gym, prepares all of her meals for the week every Sunday, and drinks loads of water.&nbsp; She has also released a book on healthy living that has been well-received, entitled <i>The Body Book</i>.&nbsp; The reason that it has been so successful thus far is that it seems to be well-researched and because she hasn't skipped over any of the parts about the body that are less than glamorous, despite the fact that she is a movie star.&nbsp; Though she has quit smoking along with all of her other previous bad habits, she recently made a controversial remark comparing smoking to drinking diet soda pop, and how the latter is worse.&nbsp; It’s probably safe to say that you should skip both, as neither is good, even in moderation.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=miranda-kerr>1. &nbsp;Miranda Kerr</h2><p>Supermodel <a title="Miranda Kerr Net Worth" href=#>Miranda Kerr</a> is number one on the list because she truly embodies every aspect of healthy living.&nbsp; She regularly exercises and does so in a variety of creative ways.&nbsp; From doing ballet exercises to sometimes spending up to ten minutes per day doing planks at home, Kerr ensures that not a day goes by without engaging her muscles in some way.&nbsp; Furthermore, she pays close attention to what she feeds those muscles.&nbsp; She eats organically, with a focus on lots of vegetables and lean proteins.&nbsp; In order to be sure that she is following the right regime, Kerr even took some courses to become a certified holistic health practitioner.&nbsp; This designation also armed her with some knowledge to launch her own line of organic skincare, KORA Organics, which took her four years to develop with an organic pharmacist.&nbsp; Because your skin is the largest organ in surface area, it absorbs a great deal, including chemicals that can go straight to your bloodstream.&nbsp; Kerr hopes to curb this by providing skin products that are not harmful to the body and that keep us in touch with nature.&nbsp; The final step in Kerr’s holistic approach is maintaining a healthy mind, something that she does through yoga and meditation.&nbsp; She has written two books on self-improvement and self-love for women of her generation, <i>Treasure Yourself</i> and <i>Empower Yourself</i>.&nbsp; She is certainly a celebrity leader in the mind-body-green revolution.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqttdKtZm5ln5t6tbTEZp%2BemZyptaqx0q1knJ2cmq%2BztdOinKxn</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./susan-lynch.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Is Northern Irish actress, Susan Lynch dating anyone after her divorce with Craig Parkison?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./white-lotus-season-2-cast-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Whos In HBOs White Lotus Season 2 And What Are They Worth?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./worlds-smallest-and-richest-countries-worth-visiting.html>10 Of The World's Smallest And Richest Countries</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breakfast-eatery-dessert-shop-headed-downtown-rock-hill.html>Breakfast eatery, dessert shop headed to downtown Rock Hill WSOC TV</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1430237-shannon-moore-is-6-years-sober-credits-wwe-for-saving-his-life.html>Shannon Moore Is 6 Years Sober, Credits WWE For Saving His Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./laconic-crossword-clue-99949425.html>Laconic Crossword Clue - News</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lionel-messi-world-cup-argentina-final.html>Lionel Messi doesnt need the ball to hurt you</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy;
