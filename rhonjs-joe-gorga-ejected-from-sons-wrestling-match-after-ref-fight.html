In a video obtained by <a href=# rel=noopener>TMZ</a>, Joe can be seen getting up from his seat in the bleachers and walking to the center of the gym floor to confront the ref.</p><p>As Joe approached the official, two other men began to restrain him and push him toward the door. They could be heard saying, “Get out!” as Joe continued to yell at the referee.</p><p>A rep for Joe told TMZ that the reality star “felt the ref made some bad and unfair calls during the match, and Gino’s opponent was mistreating him.” The spokesperson went on to say that Joe never had “any intentions of hurting anyone or getting physical” and “let his emotions get the best of him.”</p><p>Joe shares Gino with wife <strong>Melissa Gorga</strong>, whom he wed in 2004. The duo are also the parents of daughter Antonia, 18, and son Joey, 13.</p><p>All three of the Gorga kids have appeared on RHONJ, which Melissa, 44, and Joe joined as full-time cast members in season 3. As RHONJ fans may recall, Melissa and Joe’s youngest son, Joey, was still a baby when their tenure on the Bravo series began.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/RHONJs-Joe-Gorga-Ejected-From-16-Year-Old-Son-Ginos-Wrestling-Match-After-Argument-With-Referee2.jpg><p>Melissa and Joe have opened up over the years about how it feels to be raising teenagers. In 2021, <a href=#>Melissa joked to Us Weekly</a> that her husband was having a hard time adjusting to the idea of Antonia starting to date.</p><p>“He just doesn’t get it,” she explained. “He just looks at us all cross-eyed, like, every time we talk about anything with Antonia and a boy. The fact that she’s a sophomore. Hello? This is when it happens and the sex talk happens. It’s just a real-life thing. He gasped for air, he can’t even say the word. It’s so ridiculous.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Melissa added that parenting hasn’t gotten any easier as her kids have gotten older. “I’m, like, worried all the time [when] she wants to go to a party,” she told Us. “She needs rides. ‘Are you in the car? Do you have your seatbelts on?’ It’s a whole different world.”</p><p>Antonia <a href=#>graduated from high school</a> in June 2023. “I will NEVER not see you with an oversized bow and a gigantic tutu,” Melissa wrote via Instagram at the time alongside photos from the special day. “Spread your wings and fly my girl🪽🪽🪽🪽 I love you more than you know.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKmhp56fwG62zp5koKeinK5uscmemq2dlGKzs7vMZqqopqNixLOx0q2joqaXYrqiwMKhZJqepJq%2Fbr7En2SfoZedwXA%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./seun-kuti.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Seun Kuti</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./revisit-billie-eilishs-most-empowering-quotes-about-her-body.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Revisit Billie Eilish's Most Empowering Quotes About Her Body</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./worlds-smallest-and-richest-countries-worth-visiting.html>10 Of The World's Smallest And Richest Countries</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breakfast-eatery-dessert-shop-headed-downtown-rock-hill.html>Breakfast eatery, dessert shop headed to downtown Rock Hill WSOC TV</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1430237-shannon-moore-is-6-years-sober-credits-wwe-for-saving-his-life.html>Shannon Moore Is 6 Years Sober, Credits WWE For Saving His Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./laconic-crossword-clue-99949425.html>Laconic Crossword Clue - News</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lionel-messi-world-cup-argentina-final.html>Lionel Messi doesnt need the ball to hurt you</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JotBlog.
