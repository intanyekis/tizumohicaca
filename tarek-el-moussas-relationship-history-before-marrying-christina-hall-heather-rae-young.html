The couple also debuted their HGTV series <a href=#>The Flipping El Moussas, which fans didn't enjoy</a>.</p><p>Tarek El Moussa's second wife has a lot in common with his first wife Christina Hall. They both have successful real estate careers, popular social media accounts, and have starred on multiple reality shows. But while Tarek's two marriages have been highly publicized, not much is known about what his love life looked like before he met Christina and Heather.</p><h2 id=who-did-tarek-el-moussa-date-before-he-married-christina-hall>Who Did Tarek El Moussa Date Before He Married Christina Hall?</h2><p><a href=#>Christina Hall has a higher net worth than Tarek El Moussa</a>, but the two are still examples of the kind of success that people can achieve in the real estate world. Tarek El Moussa and Christina Hall were married from 2009 to 2018 and since they co-starred on Flip Or Flop, they were a great team. Of course, things got messy when they split up, and Tarek married Heather Rae Young in 2021.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Tarek hasn't been very open about what his dating life looked like prior to 2005. Did he have any serious relationships?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/christina-hall-tarek-el-moussa.jpg><p>According to People, Christina and Tarek became pals in 2005, and their relationship started in October 2006. People reported that Christina and Tarek maintained a platonic relationship when they first got to know each other because Tarek had a girlfriend at the time.</p><p>However, People didn't share any details about who that girlfriend was or what that relationship looked like. It doesn't seem like Tarek has ever spoken about it.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Was Christina In The Country A Ratings Hit For HGTV Or Did Christina Hall’s Brand Get Tired Fast?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Things moved fast between Christina and Tarek. They actually began living together the same day that they decided to date. Since Tarek fell in love with Christina quickly, it's possible that the other relationship wasn't serious. It sounds like he was able to move on easily. Tarek and Christina didn't wait long before marrying in 2009 and having their children Taylor and Brayden.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/christina-hall-tarek-el-moussa-2.jpg><p>The couple was in their 20s when they started their relationship.

She became famous at the same time as him, and they are both used to talking to the press about their personal lives.

According to Country Living, Tarek said that he and Christina were "both trying to get back into the dating scene." Tarek explained to Country Living, "I'm just kind of doing my own thing. I'm enjoying being single. I have a lot of friends. I go out and have a good time and focus on my kids and my career." It seems that Tarek was dating casually and not thinking too much about the future at the time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Country Living reported that Tarek actually mentioned his love life on Flip Or Flop.
