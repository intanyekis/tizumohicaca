A versatile thespian with many years of experience, Walters is definitely a star to watch.

Find out lesser-known facts about the star actress…</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=lucy-walters-bio-age></span><strong>Lucy Walters Bio (Age)</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Lucy Walters has not made her exact&nbsp;birth date public knowledge but it is no secret that the English actress from Oxfordshire was born on the 20th of May. More so, details&nbsp;regarding her parents, early life, and education have not been&nbsp;made public. But in an interview, Walters once revealed that her theatrical inclinations began from her childhood days. Given her love for storytelling, she joined the&nbsp;Houston Grand Opera as a kid. She also learned to play the piano as a child and once nurtured&nbsp;dreams of progressing to musical theatre.</p><p>To further hone her skills, Walters studied theatre in college at the University of Texas, Austin. Her decision to switch to acting came as an afterthought&nbsp;following her relocation to New York a few years ago. This was because she was awakened to the realization of the power that comes with good plays and films. Today, the rest is history as Walter feels at peace with her choice of career.</p><p>Walters’ versatile talents can be seen in several hit movies and TV shows portraying different characters. Notably, some of her renowned movie features include Shame (2011),&nbsp;The Brass Teapot (2012),&nbsp;Bastards of Young (2013),&nbsp;B-Side (2013), Lies I Told My Little Sister (2014), Here Alone (2016),&nbsp;and many more. She also has various TV appearances to her credit such as&nbsp;Blue Bloods, The Good Wife, Power,&nbsp;Gossip Girl, Army Wives,&nbsp;Get Shorty, and Falling Water, among others.</p><p>For now, Lucy seems to be solely focused on her career. Though she sometimes has complicated feelings about her job, she remains steadfast nurturing hopes of landing bigger and more challenging roles in big budget movies.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-she-married-who-is-her-husband-or-boyfriend></span><strong> Is She Married? Who Is Her Husband Or Boyfriend?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Given that there are no official records to the contrary, it is safe to say that Lucy Walters has never been married and is perhaps single. Lucy’s private lifestyle has left the public with several speculations about her life including unconfirmed claims that she is secretly married.</p><p>Unlike most other celebrities, Walters has not been romantically linked to anyone since she came into the limelight. There are no records of her past relationship nor a current one. However, the closest clue the public has had into her dating life is onscreen from her role as Holly in the series Power, where Tommy (Joseph Sikora) is Holly’s love interest.</p><p>Following the chemistry between the duo in the&nbsp;popular TV show, speculations emerged that they may possibly be real-life lovers. But Joseph later publicly clarified the insinuations in a 2015&nbsp;tweet stressing that he was a married man while Lucy was in a relationship.</p><p>More so, the mystery surrounding Lucy’s personal life has also led many to believe that she is a mother to actress Carolyn Dodd. But fans of the TV series Get Shorty&nbsp;are aware that the mother-daughter relationship between the&nbsp;two ladies is perhaps just onscreen. In the series, Lucy plays the role of Katie Daly the mother of Emma Daly (Carolyn Dodd). In fact, Walters further stoked the speculations when she made an Instagram post in 2018 sending birthday felicitations to her onscreen daughter.&nbsp;So far, Lucy Walters has succeeded in keeping details of her personal life under wraps leaving the public with just speculations.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=height-and-other-interesting-facts></span><strong>Height and Other Interesting Facts</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><strong>1.</strong> Lucy Walters may not be one of your tallest favorites&nbsp;nor the shortest.
