In the early hours of January 26 in Deerfield Beach, Hellen Pachon was using a motorized scooter when she was struck by a pickup truck near Northeast 3rd Avenue and 48th Street.</p><p>Paola Andrea Duran, her mother, said the 21-year-old has <a href=#>life-threatening injuries</a> to her head and lungs, as well as two fractured legs and three broken ribs. Due to the injuries, doctors at Broward Health North have determined that Pachon's left <a href=#>leg must be amputated</a>, as reported by <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Independent.</a></p><p><strong>READ MORE</strong></p><p><a href=# rel>Woman divorces husband after unearthing his 'sick, twisted' online fantasy involving her sister and children</a></p><p><a href=#>Tragic death of JJ Hammond: Mom Jennifer Keim gets 4-year probation after disabled son, 15, dies</a></p><h2 class=split><strong>Who is Hellen Pachon?</strong></h2><p>For about a year, Hellen Pachon had been living in the US and working to support her two brothers as well as Duran, who still resided in Colombia.&nbsp;</p><p>According to the authorities, Pachon was on a scooter when she crashed into a car near Deerfield Beach. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Telemundo 51</a> reports that the driver remained on the scene. It is unclear if charges will be brought in this instance.</p><h2 class=split>What did Paola Andrea Duran say?</h2><p>Duran begged the US Embassy in Colombia on social media for days to step in and let her see her daughter. Following her arrival in the US last week, Duran was finally able to visit her daughter, according to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">NBC 6.</a></p><p>Pachon's severe brain injury worried medical professionals at Broward Health North the most. Duran claimed that the medical professionals had told her that since her daughter was still receiving life support, there was nothing more they could do to help her. "She's always been a fighter," Duran said through tears to the site in Spanish. “I know she can recover from this.”</p><p>Doctors have warned Duran that her daughter's prognosis is poor and that she would almost certainly have to make the decision to remove Pachon from life support. “I just called the hospital and they told me that the injuries on her left leg are too severe, they’ll have to amputate,” Duran told Telemundo last week. Duran will be permitted to stay in the United States for three months.</p><p>"Every driver of a vehicle shall exercise due care to avoid colliding with any pedestrian or any person propelling a human-powered vehicle and give warning when necessary and exercise proper precaution upon observing any child or any obviously confused or incapacitated person," according to Florida Vehicle Code 316.130. When a driver fails to slow down in order to prevent colliding with a scooter rider, there may be grounds for a negligence claim.</p><p>Commercial pickup trucks are frequently employed. If a pickup truck driver was at work at the time of the accident, their employer could be held liable. Companies are generally accountable for the improper actions of their workers while performing their employment tasks. A pickup truck driver, for example, could have been delivering building supplies when they crashed. Victims of scooter accidents frequently sustain severe and costly injuries, such as bone fractures, injuries to the head, and lacerations.</p><p>When it comes to car accidents, Florida is a no-fault state. Any person who is catastrophically harmed as a result of a driver's careless behavior, on the other hand, may be entitled to seek some form of justice through a civil claim. A legal claim for damages can assist pay many of the costs associated with a major accident. A scooter accident lawyer can look over all of the details of your case and advise you on your legal choices, as reported by <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Torklaw.</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRor5ikeqq%2FjKGcpaSVo3qxrcKhpqdlnaS6brPErapmraNiwbOt1Z6jZq6ZqK5uwM5mraKrmal6pa3UoJ%2BtnaJivK95y6KdnmWjqr2xu9GtZJqepJq%2Fbr%2FCmqmyZZOnrrS0</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./affordable-dentures-implants-to-open-in-fairview-heights-illinois-1002103938.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Affordable Dentures &amp;amp; Implants To Open In Fairview Heights, Illinois</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./randy-orton-biography.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Randy Orton Biography</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./worlds-smallest-and-richest-countries-worth-visiting.html>10 Of The World's Smallest And Richest Countries</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breakfast-eatery-dessert-shop-headed-downtown-rock-hill.html>Breakfast eatery, dessert shop headed to downtown Rock Hill WSOC TV</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1430237-shannon-moore-is-6-years-sober-credits-wwe-for-saving-his-life.html>Shannon Moore Is 6 Years Sober, Credits WWE For Saving His Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./laconic-crossword-clue-99949425.html>Laconic Crossword Clue - News</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lionel-messi-world-cup-argentina-final.html>Lionel Messi doesnt need the ball to hurt you</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JotBlog.
