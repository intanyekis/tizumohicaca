The information was then collected and analyzed via spectrograms, or graphs tracking wavelength frequencies.</p><p>Of all the songs performed by Swift during her show, the data determined that “Shake It Off” produced the largest local magnitude of 0.85, followed by “Love Story,” which also had a significant amplitude.</p><p>The L.A. show <a href=#>wasn’t the first time</a> the Grammy winner caused what’s become known as a “Swift-quake.” Her July 2023 stops at Seattle’s Lumen Field was similarly stated to have resulted in seismic activity, according to CNN, creating an “equivalent of a 2.3 magnitude earthquake.”</p><p>Swift’s Era Tour kicked off in Glendale, Arizona, in March 2023 and has since taken her all across the United States, performing for more than three hours and surprising attendees with new acoustic songs each night. For her international leg, Swift has traveled to South America, Japan, Singapore and Australia.</p><p>Swift’s concerts broke multiple attendance records, with the Guinness World Records announcing it was officially the highest-grossing music tour ever, becoming the first to surpass $1 billion dollars in revenue.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>While Swift’s Eras Tour will continue overseas in Europe in May, the pop star is currently taking time to relax. Us Weekly confirmed that Swift is <a href=# rel=noopener>vacationing in The Bahamas</a> with her boyfriend, <strong>Travis Kelce</strong>.</p><p>The couple were spotted on an island getaway on Monday, March 18, per photos shared via gossip blog Deux Moi.</p><p>In addition to touring, Swift has been working on new music. Her 11th studio album, <a href=# rel=noopener>The Tortured Poets Department</a>, will arrive on April 19.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKuasZykv26%2F1qKdrWWWlru0ecKarKydlGKyor7ToaiumZuaeqXB0aKloGWcYq5usdGaqmasn6q%2Fbq%2FOp5qeqqRk</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./married-at-first-sight-uk-2021-cast-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>All the Ladies of Married at First Sight UK and Where to Find Them</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./talitha-pol.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Talitha Pol</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./worlds-smallest-and-richest-countries-worth-visiting.html>10 Of The World's Smallest And Richest Countries</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breakfast-eatery-dessert-shop-headed-downtown-rock-hill.html>Breakfast eatery, dessert shop headed to downtown Rock Hill WSOC TV</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1430237-shannon-moore-is-6-years-sober-credits-wwe-for-saving-his-life.html>Shannon Moore Is 6 Years Sober, Credits WWE For Saving His Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./laconic-crossword-clue-99949425.html>Laconic Crossword Clue - News</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lionel-messi-world-cup-argentina-final.html>Lionel Messi doesnt need the ball to hurt you</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JotBlog.
